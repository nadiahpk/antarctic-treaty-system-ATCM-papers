REDUCING SEWAGE POLLUTION IN THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT USING A SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT

Reducing sewage pollution in the Antarctic marine environment using a 
sewage treatment plant

In recent years a number of national Antarctic operators have installed sewage and waste-water treatment plants at research stations in Antarctica in order to reduce pollution.  In February 2003, a sewage treatment plant was installed at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Rothera Research Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula.  This Information Paper describes an environmental monitoring study undertaken by BAS to assess the effectiveness of the sewage treatment plant in reducing pollution in the local Antarctic marine environment, using faecal coliforms as a sewage marker. The results show that after one year of operation the treatment plant had reduced dramatically the microbiological pollution in the near-shore marine environment around the station sewage outfall, and seawater quality conformed to European Union bathing water standards.  This study has shown that technology now exists for effective sewage treatment in the extreme climate and logistically challenging conditions found in Antarctica. The use of this technology at all Antarctic research stations with sizable populations would help to reduce human impact on the Antarctic marine environment.

This research was published by the BAS in the international peer-reviewed scientific literature in 2004. See: Hughes, K. A.  (2004).

Despite Antarctica being the largest pristine wilderness on Earth, many coastal Antarctic research stations release untreated sewage waste into the marine environment, which may have negative effects on local wildlife.  In February 2003 a sewage treatment plant was installed at Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula).  After one year of operation the sewage treatment plant had dramatically reduced the microbiological pollution in the near-shore marine environment around the outfall and seawater quality conformed to European Union bathing water standards.

Introduction
Antarctica is the largest pristine wilderness remaining on Earth.  However, of the 44 permanently manned Antarctic research stations, the majority dispose of untreated sewage waste into the sea.  Annex III of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty legislates to protect the Antarctic environment against pollution by Antarctic operators, however there is no requirement that research stations undertake sewage treatment other than maceration (Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, 1991).  Once released, sewage microorganisms can remain viable in low temperature Antarctic waters for prolonged periods (Smith et al., 1994; Statham & McMeekin, 1994) and have the potential to infect and cause disease, or become part of the gut flora of local sea mammal and bird populations as well as fish and marine invertebrates (Lenihan et al., 1995; Gardner et al., 1997; Edwards et al., 1998; Stark et al., 2003).  
The extent of sewage plumes from several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic research stations outfalls have been recorded using sewage microorganisms as markers (Howington et al., 1992; McFeters et al., 1993; Delille & Delille, 2000; Delille and Gleizon, 2003; Hughes, 2003; Hughes and Blenkharn, 2003).  However, only one study has been performed following the installation of a sewage treatment plant, which revealed that the sewage was not always treated efficiently (Bruni et al., 1997).  
In February 2003, a sewage treatment plant was installed at Rothera Research Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o34’S, 68o08’W) (Fig. 1).  This study examined the effectiveness of the sewage treatment plant in reducing pollution in the local Antarctic marine environment, using faecal coliforms as a sewage marker.

Materials and Methods
Rothera Research Station is a permanently manned British station situated on a rocky promontory projecting into Marguerite Bay (Figure 1).  Between Feb 1976 and Jan 2003 untreated sewage containing human waste, grey water and food waste was released via a sewage outfall onto the high tide mark in North Cove.  In Feb 2003 a submerged aerated biological filter sewage treatment plant (Hodge Separators Ltd, Penryn, Cornwall, UK) was commissioned at Rothera.  After this date, dewatered sewage sludge was removed from Antarctica for disposal in the UK, while liquid effluent was UV sterilized before release into North Cove.

Enumeration of faecal coliforms in North Cove
Water samples (500 ml) were collected in sterile plastic bottles from North Cove before (11-12 Feb 1999) and after (23 Dec 2003 and 11 Feb 2004) the installation of the sewage treatment plant (see Fig. 1 for sample site locations).  Samples were collected in February 1999 and 2004 as the base populations were at their yearly maxima (80-90 people) compared with the wintering population of ~22.  Samples were collected 1 m below the water surface and immediately taken to the laboratory for analysis.  Faecal coliforms in the water samples were enumerated on membrane lauryl sulphate broth (MLSB) plus 1.5 % agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) using the membrane filtration technique according to established procedures (Anon., 1994).  Maps were created of faecal coliform distribution in North Cove using ARC INFO version 7.2. 

Results
Figures 2a and b show the concentration of faecal coliforms in North Cove four years before (Feb 1999) and one year after (Feb 2004) the sewage treatment plant was installed (Feb 2003).  In Feb 1999 the sewage plume extended 575 m to the north and >800 m to the east of the outfall.  However, in Feb 2004, following installation of the sewage treatment plant, faecal coliforms were not detected >50 m from the outfall.  Sewage distribution data collect in Dec 2003 (results not shown) revealed a plume similar in extent to that recorded in Feb 2004. 

Discussion
This study has shown that the sewage treatment plant at Rothera Research Station is effective at reducing the concentration of the faecal coliforms released into the Antarctic near-shore marine environment (c.f. Hughes, 2003; Hughes and Blenkharn, 2003).  The seawater around the outfall in North Cove now conforms to European Union Bathing Water Standards of <2,000 faecal coliforms 100 ml-1 seawater.  The only other published report detailing sewage plume extent around an operational sewage treatment plant in Antarctica (Bruni et al., 1997) showed that when the station population was high, the plant was unable to cope with the high sewage input level and did not perform satisfactorily.  A new plant has since been installed (Lori et al., 1996).  At Rothera Research Station pollution levels were very low, even when station population numbers were at their annual maximum.
Halton and Nehlsen (1968) recommended that sewage should receive full treatment before being released into the polar environment.  Currently, sewage treatment plants are installed at a minority of Antarctic research station, however, the number is increasing (el Naggar & Schoppe, 1994; Lori et al., 1996; Knox et al., 2001).  New sewage treatment plants using similar technology to that employed at Rothera Research Station have recently been installed at both McMurdo Station (US station; up to 1000 personnel) and Scott Base (New Zealand station; up to 80 personnel).  This study has shown that technology exists for effective sewage treatment in the logistically challenging conditions found in Antarctic. The use of this technology at all Antarctic research stations with sizable populations would greatly reduce human impact on the Antarctic marine environment.
