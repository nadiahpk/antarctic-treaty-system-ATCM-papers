ANNUAL LIST OF BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS  PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANNEX I, ARTICLE 6, PARAGRAPH 1 OF THE PROTOCOL) - 2004/2005 SEASON
ANNUAL LIST OF BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS

The Brazilian Antarctic Programme is currently conducting the XXII Antarctic Operation, which started on November 1st, 2004, and ends on October 31st, 2005. Of the 29 approved scientific projects and subprojects, 23 undertake field work at the Brazilian Antarctic Station “Comandante Ferraz” (EACF) -, and in the Oceanographic and Support Ship “Ary Rongel” (NApOc Ary Rongel) ), during the 2004/2005 summer season.

All activities for the XXIII Antarctic Operation were submitted to a preliminary assessment of environmental impact. Their predicted impacts were  considered to be less than minor or transitory (< MT). According to Annex I of the Protocol, there was no need to perform any initial or Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations on the research activities. There was, however, one logistic activity which needed to perform Initial Environmental Evaluation.  That was the Brazilian Refuge “Padre Rambo” Clean up.
As required in terms of the Protocol I on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, pursuant to Annex I, Article 6, paragraph 1, we enclose below the annual list of Brazilian Preliminary and Initial Environmental Evaluations (PEE/IEE), prepared in accordance with Article 2.

The List below comprises only the projects which undertake  field work.
