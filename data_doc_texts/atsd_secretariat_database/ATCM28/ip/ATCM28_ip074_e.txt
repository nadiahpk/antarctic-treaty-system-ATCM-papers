DEVELOPMENT PRESSURES ON THE ANTARCTIC WILDERNESS 
 
1.   Introduction 
 
In 2004 the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) tabled information paper ATCM 
XXVII IP 094 “Are new stations justified?”.  The paper highlighted proposals for the construction 
of no less than five new Antarctic stations in the context of at least 73 established stations (whether 
full year or summer only), maintained by 26 States already operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area.  
The paper considered what was driving the new station activity in Antarctica, whether or not it was 
necessary or desirable, and what alternatives there might be to building yet more stations.  
 
Whilst IP 094 focused on new station proposals, it noted that there were other significant 
infrastructure projects underway in Antarctica, which included substantial upgrades of existing 
national stations, the development of air links to various locations in Antarctica and related 
runways, and an ice road to the South Pole.  Since then, ASOC has become aware of additional 
proposals for infrastructure projects.    
 
This paper updates ASOC’s ATCM XXVII IP 094 to include most infrastructure projects planned 
or currently underway in Antarctica as of April 2005, and discusses their contribution to cumulative 
impacts.    
 
The criteria used to select these projects are: 
1. The project’s environmental impact is potentially “more than minor or transitory”;  
2. The project results in a development of infrastructure that is significant in the Antarctic 
context;  
3. The project takes place in parts of Antarctica that are essentially virgin or pristine,1 which 
condition will change irreversibly as a result of the project; and/or 
4. The project enhances access to remote areas of Antarctica. 
 
It should be noted that ASOC is not a priori opposed to any of the development activities 
mentioned here – although we have reservations about the motivations for some of them, and the 
effectiveness of the EIA process followed in others.   
                                                
1 By this is meant areas that were previously remote and where no substantive infrastructure has previously stood.

2.   Overview of the projects  
 
ASOC has compiled a list of 17 infrastructure projects planned or already underway (Table 1). 2  
Appendix 1 provides additional information on each project.

Each of the projects listed here meets one or more of the criteria listed above.  
 
The projects fall into four categories: (i) new station construction; (ii) upgrade of existing stations; 
(iii) development of inter- and intra-continental transportation links and (iv) large-scale research 
projects (Fig 1).   
 
Eighteen Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) are undertaking 15 of these projects.  Two 
Non Consultative Parties (NCPs) are carrying out the remaining two projects.  Most ATCPs – but

not all of them – have legislation implementing the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes, in accordance to their respective legal systems.  ASOC’s 
understanding is that the process of acceding to the Protocol is underway in both NCPs.

An EIA under the Protocol has been prepared and submitted to the Committee for Environmental 
Protection (CEP) for at least ten of the projects.5  Of these, nine have been Comprehensive 
Environmental Evaluations (CEEs), of which at least three reached the final stage, and one an Initial 
Environmental Evaluation (IEE) (Fig. 2).  (Of course, it is not mandatory to submit IEEs to the 
CEP, merely an annual list of those prepared.)

At least five of the projects, including subglacial lake research, will take place partly or fully in 
essentially pristine sites.   
 
Since ATCM XXVII, at least seven of these projects have started, and two have apparently been 
completed.  Most of the projects are due to be completed by 2007 or earlier.  At least four of the 
projects are explicitly linked to the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-08, and the IPY may have 
influenced the timing of the other projects.   
 
3. Contribution of science and associated logistics to cumulative impacts 
 
The present trend of Antarctic research appears to be towards growing infrastructure development 
in remote and/or pristine areas.   Each of the infrastructure development project listed here may be 
worthwhile in is own right, but in connection with other past, present and foreseeable future 
Antarctic activities they have the potential to cause significant cumulative impacts on the Antarctic 
environment and on the intrinsic value of Antarctica that the Protocol seeks to protect.   
 
The projects described here will take place in the lead up period to the IPY 2007-08.  During the 
period between March 2007 and March 2009 the IPY is expected to be an “intensive burst of 
internationally coordinated … scientific research” 6 at the polar regions, bringing together 
international and interdisciplinary cooperation, with the goals of “develop[ing] … new logistical 
capabilities”, and “leav[ing] a legacy of observing sites , facilities and systems to support ongoing 
polar research and monitoring”.  By April 2005, 261 “Expressions of Intent” for Antarc tic research 
during the IPY 2007-2008 had been submitted to the IPY Planning Group. As per the request of the 
Planning Group, research projects requiring substantial logistical support were registered at this 
early stage. As a result, the current list of Antarctic projects proposed for IPY includes large-scale 
projects such as traverses, deep ice core drilling and subglacial lake exploration – some of which 
are listed here.  
 
The IPY Planning Group has specified that IPY projects should “follow guidelines, as appropriate, 
to be ethically and environmentally sensitive” 7 and “maximize effective utilization of available 
logistical assets, as appropriate” 8.  Environmental considerations are not among the criteria that the

Planning Group uses to identify research projects for IPY endorsement.9  They appear to be only 
desirable characteristics of IPY projects.  Thus, the environmental considerations for IPY- related 
projects and other projects taking place simultaneously are left to the standard EIA process under 
the Protocol, with EIAs produced by individual Parties and discussed, as appropriate, at the 
meetings of the Committee for Environmental Protection.  Generally speaking the focus of this 
process are individual projects and EIAs.   
 
In view of the expanding human activities in the Antarctic, on the one hand, and current Antarctic 
EIA practise, on the other hand, ASOC wonders whether or not anybody is looking at the 
cumulative impact of the activities being planned for the lead up period to the IPY, and those of the 
IPY itself. 
 
The environmental impact assessments required under Arts. 3 and 8, and Annex I of the Protocol 
require the consideration of cumulative impacts.  In most of the EIAs prepared for the projects 
examined in this document greater emphasis has been placed on the direct impact of the 
development project itself, and lesser emphasis on the cumulative and downstream impacts of the 
new facilities.  Recent intersessional work has resulted in some progress in improving cumulative 
impacts assessment, mainly on understanding that a greater information exchange that hitherto is 
required among all operators. However, to a considerable extent the assessment and monitoring of 
cumulative impacts remains as elusive as ever.   
 
The projects examined in this document raise several key issues from the perspective of cumulative 
impacts:    
- 
At a local scale there is the cumulative effect of the proposed activities on the sites in which 
they occur, when combined with past, present and foreseeable future activities at those sites.   
- 
At an Antarctic-wide scale – and particularly for those developments taking place in remote 
areas – the progressive encroachment on a vast but ultimately finite wilderness is another form 
of cumulative impact. 
 
In addition, the expansion of scientific infrastructure should not been considered in isolation but in 
the broader context of expanding Antarctic activities not related to scientific research, such as 
commercial activities.  Furthermore, it should be noted that some of the infrastructure that is 
primarily developed for scientific use – such as the establishment of transportation networks – 
might be of interest to the tourism industry, as well as to other economic interests in the Antarctic

region (even though non-scientific uses are explicitly excluded for some of the projects).   Thus, 
there is a potential for additive and synergistic interactions between scientific activities in 
Antarctica and other kinds of activities in the region, which interactions could result in greater 
cumulative impacts than those resulting from science and associated logistics alone.   
 
4. Closing remarks  
 
Collectively, the infrastructure projects discussed here represent a significant increase of 
development pressures on the Antarctic wilderness, at a larger scale and further dispersed than 
hitherto, all taking place within the next few years.   
 
There are many reasons for these projects. Some of them are driven by science needs including the 
International Polar Year 2007-08.  Others may be primarily driven by national perceptions of the 
desirability of a new base or a “significant” project.  Economic or geopolitical reasons may be 
contributing factors too.  However, in ASOC’s view, improving the ability to carry out globally 
significant science should be the main driver for building or upgrading any facilities in the 
Antarctic.  All alternatives should be carefully considered before deciding to develop infrastructure, 
especially in hitherto pristine regions. 
 
ASOC encourages all Antarctic Treaty states to ensure that the IPY 2007-2008 leaves a legacy of 
environmentally responsible scientific practice that is compatible with the designation, objectives 
and principles of the Antarctic Treaty and its Environmental Protocol, and international 
sustainability principles.  A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) – or an equivalent 
assessment – should address the totality of projects planned for the IPY. This approach would be in 
tune with current international approaches to significant infrastructure development, including that 
of many individual Antarctic Treaty states and the European Union as a whole.  
 
In addition, ASOC recommends that the Committee for Environmental Protection, in consultation 
with SCAR and COMNAP, reviews on a regular basis issues of cumulative impacts resulting from 
the various developments discussed in this paper, in order to maximise research opportunities while 
minimising development pressures on the Antarctic wilderness.
