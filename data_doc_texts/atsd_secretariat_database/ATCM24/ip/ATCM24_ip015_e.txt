1.1 
A) Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraphs 1 
and 2, of the Protocol 
 
The Swedish government decided  September, 12,  1991 to sign the Protocol on Envi-
ronmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. After acceptance by Parliament,  the 
Government decided to ratify the Protocol  December, 16,  1993. The instrument of 
Ratification was deposited with the Government of the USA on March 29, 1994.  
 
The Protocol is published in the English and French versions  together with the Swed-
ish translation in the official publication International Agreements of Sweden, SÖ 
1994:52, together with the information that the Russian and Spanish texts are avail-
able in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
A law enacting the Protocol in Sweden, the Antarctica Act,  (SFS 1993:1614) en-
tered into force on 1st April 1994. The Antarctica (Swedish Activities) Ordinance  
(SFS 1994:95), regulating the application of the Act, entered into force at the same 
time as the law, on 1st April 1994. The Swedish Polar Research Secretariat has pub-
lished these two pieces of legislation together with a translation into English,  and a 
small pamphlet "Antarctica is unique" with translation in English. It contains informa-
tion inter alia on rules for visitors, why a permit is needed to go to Antarctica and 
how to get a permit. It also informs about the Swedish legislation and the role of the 
Swedish Polar Research Secretariat.
