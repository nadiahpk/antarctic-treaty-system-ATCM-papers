Report on Development of a Larsemann Hills Antarctic Specially Managed Area 
Management Plan 
 
 
Background  
 
The managers of the Australian, Chinese and Russian Antarctic Programs have agreed to 
develop a management plan for the Larsemann Hills with a view to nominating the area as 
an Antarctic Specially Managed Area in accordance with Article 4 of Annex V to the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  
 
Progress to date 
 
In 2000 a draft ASMA Management Plan was produced with information primarily sourced 
from a review of existing literature and communication with people having first-hand 
knowledge of the area. 
 
The draft plan was circulated for comment within the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), 
Chinese Antarctic Expedition (CHINARE) and Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE). 
 
During the 2000-01 summer an Australian Antarctic Division environment officer was 
stationed at Law Base, in the Larsemann Hills to further develop the ASMA management 
plan.  The primary objectives of this fieldwork included: 
• to achieve comprehensive familiarisation with the area/environment in question 
and undertake ground-truthing of the draft management plan; 
• to collect additional information about infrastructure and station operations in 
the proposed ASMA, to ensure that the management plan is comprehensive and 
current; 
• to seek further input into the development and refinement of the management 
plan from members of the Chinese and Russian stations located in the 
Larsemann Hills; and 
• to obtain reference material (notes, photographs, video footage) and other 
baseline data to support the management plan. 
 
The next step is to redraft the management plan incorporating the information collected 
during the summer, and circulate this for comment within the AAD, RAE and CHINARE 
during 2001.  After incorporating these comments, intentions are to present the draft ASMA 
management plan to SCAR for comment in 2002 and then to the 2003 CEP Meeting for 
formal approval and endorsement.
