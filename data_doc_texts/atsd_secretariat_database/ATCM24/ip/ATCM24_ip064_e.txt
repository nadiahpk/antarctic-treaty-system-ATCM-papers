GERMAN/UK OIL SPILL EXERCISE IN ANTARCTICA 
Submitted by Germany and the UK 
 
Both Germany and the UK place considerable importance on undertaking regular oil spill 
response exercises in Antarctica. This is to ensure that both countries can provide prompt 
and effective response action in the event of a major oil spill. 
 
In accordance with Article 15 of the Environmental Protocol and Resolution 1 (1997) the 
British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the German Alfred Wegner Institute (AWI) held a 
major oil spill response exercise in Antarctica in February 2001. The exercise was carried 
out at the British Rothera Research Station and involved a simulated fuel spill from the 
Germen research vessel ‘Polarstern’. 
 
The aim of the exercise was to test the Rothera and ‘Polarstern’ contingency plans as well 
as specialised oil spill recovery equipment held on both the station and the ship. The 
exercise was also designed to test the national communication procedures in the event of 
a major emergency and to further develop the close links between BAS and AWI. 
 
The exercise simulated a small oil spill (200 litres of aviation fuel) from Polarstern whilst 
moored to the wharf at Rothera. All fuel (in reality sawdust) was recovered, and there 
was no environmental impact. 
 
The exercise was a major success and tested personnel and equipment at Rothera and 
onboard Polarstern. Lessons have been learned which will be incorporated into updates of 
the relevant contingency plans. It is planned that further joint exercises will take place in 
the future.
