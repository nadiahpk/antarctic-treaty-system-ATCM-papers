ITEM IV: REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX III, ARTICLE 9 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTOCOL 
 
Information about waste management plans prepared, and reports on implementation 
and review of these plans. 
 
A. Waste Management Plans Prepared in Accordance with Annex III, Article 8 of 
the Protocol (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol) 
The overall waste management strategy of Norwegian activity in Antarctica is that all 
waste, with the exception of grey water, and some human waste generated in field camps, 
is retrograded out of Antarctica for proper disposal at the end of the season. 
 
A Waste Management Handbook has been produced for the Norwegian national 
Antarctic research program.  The handbook has been developed in cooperation with the 
Finnish and Swedish Antarctic research programs. A copy of the Handbook can be 
obtained at the Norwegian Polar Institute’s website or from: 
 
Antarctic Environmental Officer 
Norwegian Polar Institute 
Polar Environmental Centre

(njaastad@npolar.no) 
 
 
B. Report on implementation of waste management plan (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of 
the Protocol) 
In the 2000/2001 season, due to difficult weather situation at time of departure, a depot of 
waste drums had to be left behind on the ice shelf (70º06,5' S, 005º20,5' E). It will be a 
priority for the Norwegian national operations to collect and retrograde this waste as part 
of the 01/02 national operations. 
 
 
C. Inventory of past activities in accordance with Annex III, Article 8 (3) of the 
Protocol (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol) 
No inventory of past activities has been drawn up at present time.

2001: 
1. A group of 4 persons spent 2 months at the field station Tor located in SSSI No. 
23 to conduct bird research/monitoring in the protected area.  All together 950 
seabirds (Antarctic petrel) were banded (catch and release). 250 chicks were 
moved from one nest to another for studies on population dynamics.  Weighing 
and measuring of eggs and birds in the colonies were carried out regularly 
throughout the period.  All activity was conducted in accordance with the 
management plan for the area. 
2. A two-man TV-team and one newspaper journalist was in SSSI No. 23 to report 
on the ongoing seabird research in the area. 
3. Norwegian authorities inspected SSSI no. 23. 
 
 
C. Measures taken to implement the provisions of Annex V (Annex V, Article 10 (4) 
of the Protocol) 
• 1993:  Ratification of Annex V 
• 1995:  Implementation of Annex V through national legislation 
• 1999:  Revised management plan for SSSI No. 23 tabled and adopted at CEP III.

o
Measure 1 (1999): Antarctic Protected Areas System: Revised Management 
Plan for the Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 23 Svarthamaren. 
o
Measure 1 (2000): Antarctic Protected Areas System: Revised Management 
Plans for Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. 
o
Measure 2 (2000): Antarctic Protected Areas System. Extension of expiry dates 
for certain Sites of Special Interest. 
 
 
During the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 Norway conducted one site inspection in 
an Antarctic protected area. The inspection covered SSSI No. 23 - Svarthamaren. The 
report from this inspection is available from the Norwegian authorities at the below
