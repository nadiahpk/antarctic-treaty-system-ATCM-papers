TOPOGRAPHY: The camp site is at an altitude of 1900 meters above the 
MSL in Southern Humboidt Mountains. It is on the north-western slope of 
Flanuten peak The range is on the Eastern flank of Somoveken glacier. 
 
GEOLOGY: The area around the site exposes Proterozoic metamorphic 
rocks intruded by acid and basic dykes. The gneissic terrain is dominated by 
quartzofeldspathic gneiss, quartz-biotite-garnet gneiss, garnet-sillimanite 
gneiss and sillimanite-cordierite gneiss with bands of two-pyroxene 
granulites and calc-silicates. Intrusives of pegmatites, quartz veins and 
basics are quite frequent. The paragneisses exhibit a khondalitic affinity. 
The rocks show multiple deformation, where at least three major phases of 
folding are discernible.
