4-1 Waste Management Plans Prepared in Accordance with Annex III, Article 8 of the 
Protocol (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol) 
 
The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) introduced the Waste Management Plan to 
implement necessary operating procedures such as segregation, disposal and management of wastes after 
the Madrid Protocol was completed in 1991.  
 
According to the plan, some combustible wastes are incinerated and sewage is treated by the biological 
treatment plant. The ash and the sludge are brought back to Japan. Other wastes are removed from 
Antarctic treaty area for proper disposal 
 
Larger wastes such as oversnow vehicles trucks and building materials stored at Syowa station are also 
back to Japan every year according to the five years clean up operation plan. 
  
4-2 Report on implementation of waste management plan (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the 
Protocol)
