IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY 
 
 
Information Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection 
by the United Kingdom 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 
requires each Party to report annually on the steps that they have taken to implement 
the Protocol.  Such reports should include how each Party has ensured compliance 
with the Protocol through the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions 
and enforcement measures (Article 13(3) of the Protocol refers). 
 
Article 17 also requires each Party to report on contingency plans established for 
response to incidents with potential adverse effects on the Antarctic environment and 
associated ecosystems (Article 15(1)(b) of the Protocol refers).  Further to this, 
Resolution 1 (1997) recommends Parties to carry out regular contingency exercises 
and to report on the results of the exercises. 
 
This report covers all such UK activities and actions for the period 2000-2001.  
 
Administrative Actions 
 
No further primary legislation concerning the Protocol has entered into force in the 
UK since ATCM XXIII, when it was reported that the provisions of the Antarctic Act 
1994 were fully in force.  The 2000-2001 austral season was the second season when 
all of the provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were implemented. 
New Regulations (The Antarctic (Amendment) Regulations 2000), enacting Measures 
1 and 2 (1999) and Measure 1 (2000), came into force in September 2000.  These 
Regulations enact into UK law: the Management Plans for Cape Royds Historic Site 
and its environs, Hut Point Historic Site, Cape Adare Historic Site (Measure 1 
(1999)); the South-West Coast of Elephant Island Historic Site (Measure 2 (1999)), 
and the Management Plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest number 23, 
Svarthamaren (Measure 1 (2000)).  
 
A list of all permits issued under the Antarctic Act 1994 during the 2000-2001 season 
is attached as an Annex to this paper. 
 
 
Disaster Contingency Exercise 
 
In accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol and Article 12 of Annex IV, the UK has 
continued to revise and update its contingency plans for UK ships and bases in 
Antarctica. 
 
Exercise Report 
 
In respect of Article 15 and Resolution 1 (1997), the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) 
held a joint oil spill response exercise with Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute 
(AWI) in February 2001.  The exercise was undertaken at the British Antarctic 
Survey's Rothera Research Station.  
 
The primary aim of the exercise was to test the Rothera Station contingency plan and 
the ability of the UK’s Antarctic assets, in conjunction with AWI, to respond to a 
disaster in the Antarctic. 
 
The exercise simulated a small spill (200 litres of aviation fuel) during refuelling of 
Germany’s MV Polarstern.  All fuel (in reality sawdust) was recovered.  There was 
no environmental impact.  This exercise was a good example of international co-
operation. 
 
Exercise summary 
 
Date of exercise: 
 
28/02/01 
Time:  
 
 
18.00 GMT 
Simulated fuel spill:   
200 litres aviation fuel 
Simulated cause of spill:  
Break in fuel hose from MV Polarstern 
Location:  
 
 
Rothera wharf /slipway 
Weather:  
 
 
Overcast, wind 340° at 11 kts  
Resources at potential risk:  Seawater intake at wharf, station R/O plant 
Response action:  
Bulk fuel delivery stopped, seawater supply shutdown 
as precaution, response teams mobilised 
Method:  
Response equipment deployed (i.e. Fasttanks erected, 
booms and skimmers deployed) 
Result:

Based on the findings of the exercise the contingency plan for Rothera will be further 
updated.  Emergency response exercises will continue to be undertaken on an annual 
basis.
