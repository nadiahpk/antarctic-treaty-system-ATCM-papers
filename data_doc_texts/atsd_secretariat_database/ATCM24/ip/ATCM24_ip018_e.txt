Exchange of information on the application of Articles 3 and 8 as well as 
Annex I of the Protocol  
 
submitted by Germany 
 
 
At XII SATCM Germany presented WP2 on an “Exchange of information between 
Member Parties on the application of Articles 3 and 8 as well as Annex I of the Protocol”. The 
aim of the initiative was to share information regarding Parties’ experience in the licensing 
procedure, to exchange information on the reasoning behind national decisions and to increase 
harmonised interpretation and application of the Protocol. 
 
More than three years after entry into force of the Protocol such form of cooperation 
would be very useful. 
 
As discussed at XII SATCM Germany is still interested exchanging such information 
on an informal basis with other interested Parties.
