STRATEGIC NEEDS AND DECISION-MAKING IN ANTARCTICA 
 
ASOC INFORMATION PAPER 
 
XXIV ATCM, ST. PETERSBURG 9-20 JULY 2001 
 
 
Abstract 
 
This paper explores the potential for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) concepts and 
methodologies to be adapted to the existing decision-making procedures and environmental planning 
processes used in the Antarctic context. It also evaluates the current strategic decision-making practice in 
the ATS as embodied in the establishment of ASMAs, with emphasis on the process to establish a 
Protected Area at Deception Island, and draws parallels between this process and SEA. 
 
Worldwide, many decisions affecting environmental quality and wider sustainability, are taken at the 
policy, program or planning (PPP) level, rather than at individual project or activity level. One tool used 
to aid the decision-making process is Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). SEA is a structured, 
proactive process to strengthen the role of environmental issues in strategic decision-making. 
 
The Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Protocol) 
expresses legally-based long-term goals for the region. However, the Protocol’s main mechanism to 
ensure that planning and conduct of activities conforms to these goals — environmental impact 
assessment — operates at the level of individual activities. Global environmental management experience 
shows that EIA is a necessary but not sufficient basis for achieving environmental protection goals. SEA 
does not substitute for EIA, but sets the context for project-specific EIAs. It filters out the more damaging 
projects, removing the need for detailed, expensive and controversial EIA processes later. Both EIA and 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica

SEA are needed.  
 
ASOC argues that SEA processes should be part of the Antarctic decision-making procedures.  
 
The Deception Island ASMA under development suggests that strategic, process-based discussion 
concerning long-term environmental protection is possible within the Protocol framework.  
 
ASOC hopes that the ATS will discuss longer-term strategic environmental needs. These include 
evaluating whether the Protocol’s objectives and principles are being met and whether these are sufficient 
over the longer term. Over the longer term, the principles of SEA can easily be adapted to existing ATS 
institutions and procedures. 
 
ASOC urges the Parties to move forward in developing and testing Antarctic SEA, and suggests that the 
first step is to examine existing strategic processes in the ATS for compatibility to the SEA process.  
 
 
Toma de decisiones y requerimientos estratégicos en la Antártida 
Documento Informativo de ASOC 
SUMARIO 
 
Este documento analiza el potencial para adaptar los conceptos y métodos de las Evaluaciones 
Ambientales Estratégicas (SEA, en inglés) al proceso existente de toma de decisiones y planeamiento 
ambiental que se emplea en el contexto antártico. Asimismo, evalúa el proceso actual de toma de 
decisiones en el Sistema del Tratado Antártico, como se emplea para el establecimiento de Áreas 
Antárticas Especialmente Manejadas (ASMA, en inglés), con énfasis en el proceso para establecer un área 
protegida en la Isla Decepción. Además, se traza un paralelo entre este proceso y las SEA. 
 
A nivel mundial, muchas decisiones que involucran calidad ambiental y en un sentido más amplio 
sustentabilidad, son tomadas a nivel de políticas, programas o planes (PPP), más que a nivel de proyectos 
o actividades individuales. Las SEA son una de las herramientas utilizadas para asistir en la toma de 
decisiones estratégicas. Las SEA son un proceso proactivo y estructurado para reforzar el rol de las 
cuestiones ambientales en la toma de decisiones estratégicas. 
 
El Tratado Antártico y el Protocolo de Protección Ambiental al Tratado Antártico (el Protocolo) 
contienen metas a largo plazo con base legal para la región antártica. Sin embargo, los principales 
mecanismos del Protocolo para asegurar que las actividades en la Antártida se planifiquen y lleven a cabo 
de acuerdo a estas metas son las evaluaciones de impacto ambiental, las que se aplican a las actividades 
en forma individual. La experiencia global de manejo ambiental indica que la EIA es un proceso 
necesario, pero no suficiente, para alcanzar las metas de protección ambiental. El rol de las SEA no es el 
de sustituir a las EIA para proyectos individuales, sino más bien establecer un marco de referencia. En el 
proceso de SEA se descartan los proyectos que causan mayores daños ambientales. Esto elimina la 
necesidad de llevar a cabo detallados procesos posteriores de EIA que pueden ser costosos y 
controversiales. Por lo tanto las SEA como las EIA son necesarias. 
 
ASOC propone que las SEA formen parte de los procesos de toma de decisiones que se utilizan en la 
Antártida. 
 
El proceso para el establecimiento de una ASMA en la Isla Decepción ,actualmente en curso, sugiere que 
las discusiones estratégicas sobre protección ambiental a largo plazo, son posibles en el marco del 
Protocolo.

ASOC espera que el Sistema del Tratado Antártico (ATS en inglés) discuta las cuestiones ambientales 
estratégicas a largo plazo de la Antártida. En este proceso se debe evaluar si se están alcanzando los 
objetivos del Protocolo y si a largo plazo éstos son suficientes. En el largo plazo, los principios de las 
SEA pueden ser fácilmente adaptados a las instituciones y procesos del Sistema del Tratado Antártico. 
 
ASOC hace un llamado a las Partes a desarrollar y probar las Evaluaciones Ambientales Estratégicas 
Antárticas y sugiere que el primer paso es examinar los procesos estratégicos existentes en el Sistema del 
Tratado Antártico y evaluar su compatibilidad con los procesos propios de las SEA.

Стратегические потребности и процесс принятия решений 
в Антарктике 
Информационный материал, представленный АСОК 
 
 
РЕЗЮМЕ 
 
 
  
Информационный документ исследует концепцию и методологию Стратегической Оценки 
Окружающей Среды (SEA) с целью возможного включения в систему действующих процедур 
принятия решений и планирования в вопросах, касающихся Антарктиды. Документ также 
оценивает действующую стратегию принятия решений в Системе Договора про Антарктику 
(ATS), воплощенную в создании ASMAs, с акцентированием на процессе создания охраняемой 
территории «Deception Island” и проведением параллелей между этим процессом и SEA. 
 
Хорошо известно, что большинство решений, влияющих на состояние окружающей среды 
и устойчивость экосистем в широком смысле и определяющих политику действия в регионе, 
принимаются на уровне программ или во время стратегического планирования, и гораздо реже на 
уровне реализации отдельных проектов или повседневной деятельности. Стратегическая Оценка 
Окружающей Среды (SEA) является единым инструментом, который поможет принятию решений 
на этих уровнях. Стратегическая Оценка (SEA) - это структурированный процесс, направленный 
на усиление роли охраны окружающей среды в процессе стратегического планирования и 
принятия решений. 
 
Договор про Антарктику и Протокол по охране окружающей среды (дальше Протокол) 
определяют имеющие юридическую силу долгосрочные цели в регионе. Однако, основной 
механизм, заложенный в Протоколе (система ОВОСов – (EIA)), обеспечивает достижение целей на 
уровне планирования и реализации странами-операторами конкретных проектов. Мировой опыт 
менеджмента окружающей среды показывает, что система ОВОСов необходимый, но 
недостаточный инструмент для сохранения окружающей среды. Стратегическая Оценка (SEA) не 
подменяет Всеобщую Оценку (EIA), а создает основу для ее продуктивной работы на уровне 
конкретных проектов. Она позволяет отвергать наиболее опасные для окружающей среды проекты 
на ранних этапах их подготовки, исключая, тем самым, необходимость проведения для них в 
дальнейшем детальных, дорогостоящих, и порой вызывающих разногласия процедур ВООС (EIA). 
Поэтому необходимы обе процедуры: Стратегическая (SEA) и Всеобщая (EIA) Оценки . 
 
АСОК настаивает на том, что процедура Стратегической Оценки (SEA) должна стать 
составной частью процесса принятия решений по вопросам Антарктики. 
 
Идущая дискуссия Deception Island ASMA по вопросу создания здесь охраняемой 
территории показала, что процесс обсуждения вопросов долгосрочной охраны окружающей среды 
возможен в рамках Протокола. 
 
АСОК надеется, что Система Договора про Антарктику (ATS) обсудит возможные 
дополнительные стратегические механизмы охраны окружающей среды. Они должны включать, 
как механизмы позволяющие достичь цели и выполнить задачи, поставленные Протоколом, так и 
более долгосрочные. Принципы Стратегической Оценки (SEA) легко согласуемы с действующими 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica

процедурами и могут исполнять роль таких дополнительных долгосрочных механизмов. 
 
АСОК настаивает на том, чтобы Стороны приняли идею Стратегической Оценки (SEA) и 
апробировали ее и в качестве первых шагов, предлагает проанализировать действующую в 
Системе Договора про Антарктику (ATS) процедуру стратегического планирования с точки зрения 
ее соответствия процессу Стратегической Оценки (SEA).

RESUME. 
 
 
Ce document étudie la conception et la méthodologie des Évaluations Stratégiques d’Impact sur 
l’Environnement (SEA, en anglais) dans le but de son introduction possible dans le système actuel des 
procédures de prise de décisions et de planification dans les questions concernent à l’Antarctique. Ce 
document évalue aussi la stratégie actuelle de prise de décision dans le Système de Traité 
sur l’Antarctique (ATS, en anglais), avec notamment comme exemple la création d’un territoire protégé à 
l’Île de la Déception. De plus, ce document établit les parallèles entre ces procédures et les procédures de 
SEA. 
 
Au niveau mondial, beaucoup de décisions touchant la qualité de l’environnement dans le sens 
large et le développement durable sont pris au niveau politique, des programmes ou des plans. Ces 
décisions ne sont pas prises au niveau de réalisation de projets ou activités particuliers. Un des 
instruments que peut aider l’adoption des décisions est la Évaluation Stratégique d’Impact sur 
l’Environnement. La SEA est une procédure structurée dynamique, destinée à renforcer l’importance des 
questions environnementales dans la prise de décisions stratégiques. 
 
Le Traité sur l’Antarctique et le Protocole relatif à la protection d’environnement posent de façon 
légale les bases des buts à long terme pour la région. En même temps le mécanisme principal pour 
atteindre les objectifs du Protocole est la procédure d’évaluations de l’impact sur l’environnement (EIA, 
en anglais), que se font au niveau des projets ou activités particulières. La pratique au niveau mondiale 
concernant l’administration de l’environnement démontre que l’évaluation d’impacts sur l’environnement 
des projets individuels est un instrument nécessaire mais pas suffisant pour la conservation à long terme 
du milieu. Par contre, la SEA permet de filtrer les projets les plus dangereux pour l’environnement, 
excluant ainsi la nécessite de procédures longues, coûteuses et controversées plus tard. Cependant, la SEA 
ne doit pas substituer l’EIA.  Les deux procédures sont nécessaires et complémentaires.   
 
ASOC insiste que la procédure de SEA doit être incluse dans le processus de prise de décisions 
du Traité de l’Antarctique. 
 
La discussion en cours pour la désignation d’une zone protégée a l’Ile de la Déception  démontre que la 
discussion sur les questions de protection d’environnement à long terme est possible dans le contexte du 
Protocole. 
 
ASOC espère que le Système du Traité sur la Antarctique va approfondir les mécanismes 
supplémentaires stratégiques pour la protection de l’environnement. Les principes de SEA peuvent être 
facilement adaptés aux procédures actuelles.

STRATEGIC NEEDS AND DECISION-MAKING IN ANTARCTICA 
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
 
Worldwide, many decisions that affect the quality of the environment and, in a broader sense, 
sustainability, are taken at the level of policies, programs or plans (PPPs) rather than at the level of 
individual projects or activities. Several assessment tools have been devised to facilitate taking strategic 
decisions concerning the environment. One of the tools used to aid in the decision-making process is 
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). SEA is a structured, proactive process to strengthen the role 
of environmental issues in strategic decision-making.1,2 SEA may be a consequence of formulating PPPs, 
but it can also be conducted prior or in parallel to, and therefore influence, the PPP formulation process.  
 
In the Antarctic context the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty (the Protocol) expresses legally-based long-term goals for the Antarctic region. The 
Protocol declares the intention that Antarctica should “forever” be used for peaceful purposes,3 and 
declares Antarctica as “…a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science”.4 The planning and conduct of 
all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area shall take into account the protection of the Antarctic 
environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and the intrinsic value of Antarctica.5 In practical 
terms, however, the Protocol’s main mechanism to ensure the planning and conduct of activities 
according to its mandate – environmental impact assessments – is set at the level of individual activities.  
 
At the XXIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in Lima in 1999, the CEP and the 
Consultative Meeting welcomed the suggestion of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) to 
elaborate the concept of strategic impact assessment,6, 7 and report back to the next ATCM. That report 
was submitted at the XII Special Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (SATCM) as Information Paper 
121 (IP 121). ASOC’s XII SATCM/IP 121 argued that Parties to the Protocol should take steps to 
develop and test an Antarctic Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). It further argued that in the 
face of present developments in Antarctica, the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) needed to integrate the 
concepts of environmental impact assessment into higher levels of planning and decision-making. 
 
Building on XII SATCM/IP 121, this document explores the potential for SEA concepts and 
methodologies to be adapted to the existing decision-making procedures and environmental planning 
processes used in the Antarctic context. It also evaluates the current strategic decision-making practice in 
the ATS as embodied in the establishment of ASMAs with emphasis on the process to establish a 
Protected Area at Deception Island. 
 
 
2. 
SEA concepts: A summary of ASOC’s XII SATCM/IP 121 
 
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is the process of assessing the environmental effect of 
policies, plans, and programs preceding the specific assessment and authorization of individual projects.  
 
Decisions concerning individual projects in Antarctica already require EIA. Global environmental 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica

management experience shows that EIA is a necessary but not sufficient basis for achieving 
environmental protection goals. Project-specific EIA processes generally commence after many decisions 
have (albeit often informally) in fact already been taken, alternatives discounted and a sense of 
inevitability inculcated in participants to the process.  
 
SEA and EIA are based on the same principles and have similar ultimate objectives and functions, but 
differ in scale and timing. As with EIA, SEA is a process that involves screening, scoping, and the 
preparation of an environmental impact statement. SEA is considered “strategic” because of its prior 
consideration of issues, alternatives and impacts above the level of a particular proposal”. The purpose of 
SEA is to determine what activities may take place in the context of a strategic plan, leaving EIA to 
resolve how activities should take place in order to minimize environmental impact.8 SEA cannot 
substitute for EIA, but it can set the context for project-specific EIAs, filtering out the more damaging 
projects, thus removing the need for detailed, expensive and controversial EIA processes later. Both EIA 
and SEA are needed. 
 
XXIII ATCM/IP121 made the case for using an "Antarctic SEA" to complement existing instruments in 
the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. An Antarctic SEA is consistent with the 
Protocol and would complement its Objective and Designation, Environmental Principles, and much 
existing practice. The concept of a strategic approach is, of course, already evident within the Protocol 
and wider Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) – e.g. the prohibition of minerals activities under Article 7, and 
the concept of Specially Protected Species under Annex II. 
 
Whilst Antarctic activities take place under the umbrella of the ATS, activities are regulated by national 
administrative and legal systems. Even with faithful application of the Protocol and other ATS-provisions 
by all states, there is no guarantee that undesirable impacts, especially cumulative impacts,9 will not occur 
unless a more proactive, systematic approach such as SEA is in place. 
 
As an example of SEA applications in an Antarctic context, ASOC’s XII SATCM/IP 121 responded to 
the growth of Antarctic tourism during the last decade, which has raised concerns regarding potential 
impacts. Although an EIA (often an IEE) may have been carried out for most tourist activities, the 
cumulative impacts and other issues of a more strategic character have not received attention. There are 
no Antarctic Treaty System-wide standards for the consideration of the desirability or consequences of 
continent-wide penetration by tourists, or of aspects such as the tourist levels and concentration or size of 
vessels being used. ASOC argued that, consistent with worldwide trends, Parties should adopt a more 
proactive, strategic approach to manage the increasing expansion and diversity of Antarctic activities, and 
that SEA is one of the best tools to do so.  
 
Since ASOC’s initial suggestion SEA has been proposed elsewhere as one of the potential tools for 
assessing the impacts of Antarctic tourism10 and cumulative impacts.11 Tourism was the focus of XII 
SATCM/IP 121 because it is manifestly the fastest growing Antarctic activity and may usefully be subject 
to SEA. However, SEA has wider application, particularly concerning situations of large-scale 
development or rapid growth.12  
  
 
3. SEA and the Antarctic decision-making processes 
 
 
Articles 2 and 3 of the Protocol set the general context for activities conducted under the Antarctic 
Treaty.13 These articles give the operators responsibility for the overall planning of their activities in a 
manner consistent with the objectives and principles of the Protocol (i.e. Arts. 2 and 3). This mandate and 
other resources available in the Antarctic context are consistent with the theory of SEA and with the 
possible application of SEA to Antarctic operations. It could be argued that the overall objective of the 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica 
 
8
Protocol is the maintenance of a certain, minimal level of quality of the Antarctic environment. This can 
be considered both an explicit (e.g. Art. 3(2)(b)) as well as implicit objective of the Protocol.  
 
In practice, some strategic decision-making may be required to reach that overall environmental 
objective, given the emerging quantity and diversity of activities taking place in Antarctica. In ASOC’s 
view it is not acceptable to leave Antarctic conservation to chance in the hope that this desired future 
would be reached through a lucky combination of factors. SEA would be complementary to existing tools 
and instruments available to the ATS and individual Parties, and would provide an additional tool to meet 
the objectives and principles of the Protocol and other applicable international agreements (Agenda 21 
comes to mind). SEA, however, should not an objective in itself, but a means to maintain a certain level 
of environmental quality in Antarctica into the future by taking account of environmental impacts in 
strategic actions. 
 
Strategic environmental considerations may already be part of the domestic decision-making of many 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs).14 Of note is the recent approval of the so-called SEA 
Directive by the European Union.15 In the Antarctic context some ATCPs may use strategic approaches to 
address environmental issues at the level of their national Antarctic program. At least one national 
Antarctic program (USA) has used a “programmatic EIA”, which in some cases is considered comparable 
to SEA (in many cases, however, it is simply a “large” EIA). 
 
The application of SEA concepts to the Antarctic context may require some adjustments.  First, strategic 
approaches to decision-making should fit in the existing Antarctic decision-making process at large to 
make them workable. At present decisions concerning environmental issues for the ATS as a whole are 
taken by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs). These decisions are informed by a variety 
of actors and instruments acting at diverse temporal and hierarchical levels, which include, in no specific 
order: 
 
• 
EIAs under Annex I, and in particular CEEs; 
• 
National strategic considerations of environmental issues at the level of Antarctic programmes or 
private operators (e.g. IAATO), which may translate into Party-specific initiatives, or proposals for 
action fed into the CEP or ATCM (i.e. as Working Papers or Information Papers); 
• 
The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP); 
• 
The work of intersessional working groups dealing with specific issues; 
• 
Work tasked to observers to the ATS, such as SCAR and COMNAP. 
 
The various strands of instruments and processes listed above, while individually may be effective in 
meeting their conservation goals, may not collectively provide the “lucky combination” required to ensure 
adequate long-term protection of the Antarctic environment.  
 
A second requirement is that further integration may be required. Integration creates a new entity where 
new relationships are established between individual entities. These entities have specific characteristics 
and dynamics that in combination act in a different way.16 Integration may also have different forms.17 In 
this context, integration means that new relationships and linkages are created so that the whole – in this 
case, the ATS at large – acts in a more efficient way than the combination of individual Parties’ actions in 
order to meet the environmental objectives of the Protocol.  
 
Some of the aspects in which the work of the ATS may be further integrated include: 
 
• 
Political: The integration of the Protocol and the ATS with other international treaties to which the 
ATCPs are already committed (e.g. Agenda 21); and the integration of Protocol regulations into 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica 
 
9
CCMALR. 
• 
Substantive: The integration of emerging issues (e.g. large scale Antarctic tourism) with “traditional” 
Antarctic issues and decision-making procedures, to enable addressing these issues effectively.  
• 
Methodological: The integration of the environmental and other impact assessment approaches such 
as cumulative assessment; and the integration of different applications to the use of particular tools 
such as GIS.18 
• 
Procedural: The integration of communication channels among different Antarctic operators in 
charge of the practical aspects of the implementation of the Protocol to ensure comparable standards 
of operations.19 
• 
Institutional: The provision of capacities to cope with emerging issues. 
 
Some of these integration initiatives have either already been proposed by individual ATCPs20 or are 
taking place at a national level, at times through an informal network of competent authorities.21 In this 
context, the main role of an Antarctic SEA would be to facilitate the integration process by influencing 
the way decisions are taken as a potential “sustainability management mechanism”.22  
 
In brief, emerging environmental issues in an Antarctic context require strategic decision-making. In turn, 
this requires further integration at different levels. Integration should not upset sensibilities concerning 
national decision-making powers, sovereignty claims, and other factors that constitute the reality under 
which the ATS operates even if these are seldom explicit. Antarctic SEA could be a process to facilitate 
strategic decision-making. 
 
 
4. Antarctic strategic decision-making in practice: Deception Island Management Plan 
 
In the Antarctic context, the real-life formulation of a Management Plan for Deception Island has 
followed a process with some elements in common with the SEA process.  
 
An informal meeting of the Parties active at Deception Island was held at The Hague, The Netherlands, 
on 13 September 2001 during SATCM XII and CEP III. The purpose of that meeting was to initiate 
discussions for the future management of Deception Island.  
 
Accordingly, a “Workshop on a Management Plan for Deception Island” was held at the headquarters of 
the Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) in Santiago, Chile from 26-29 March 2001. In attendance were 
representatives from Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of 
America, as well as observers from ASOC and the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators 
(IAATO). The objective of the workshop was to initiate work towards the production of a management 
plan for Deception Island, in view of a robust tourism to the island, which adequately would protect the 
island’s unique volcanic environment, flora and fauna, and historic sites. Because of the high tourism 
visitation to the island, a management plan would implicitly be a test case for the management of other 
areas where there are also high levels of tourism. In fact, the process was described as a “trailblazer”.23  
 
The concept of SEA was not explicitly included in these discussions. However, there were some elements 
of strategic thinking and action evident throughout the discussions that enable a parallel to be established 
between the usual SEA process and the establishment of Protected Areas at Deception Island. These 
parallels include: 
 
(1) Identification of objectives: There was “widespread agreement” among interested Parties for the 
need for a management plan for Deception Island.24 
 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica 
 
10
(2) Screening, scoping and situation analysis: A document entitled “A Management Strategy for 
Deception Island” was prepared by the United Kingdom for the discussions at The Hague and 
further discussed at the Santiago workshop. This document: 
• 
Described the natural and non-natural resources of Deception Island; 
• 
Described the current activities, environmental impacts and threats, and risks to health and 
safety; 
• 
Provided a framework for the sustainable management of Deception Island; 
• 
Identified seven different management options of management at Deception Island; and 
• 
Recommended one of the management options. 
 
The decision to initiate the process of drafting a Management Plan for Deception Island was primarily 
a reaction to the existing and growing level of activities at the island. However, a strategic decision 
was made to take proactive measures in anticipation of future developments, under the umbrella of 
establishing a Protected Area.  
 
(3) Formulation of guidelines and strategy for implementation and monitoring: The Workshop 
discussed the main concepts of the management strategy and other specific issues including the 
management of historic sites, scientific research, station management, tourism, and emergency 
response. As a result of these discussions, the Workshop: 
(4) Produced a “skeletal” draft Management Plan that incorporated the main concepts of the 
management strategy; 
(5) Agreed on terms of reference for the tasks ahead; and 
(6) Delegated tasks (e.g., revision of existing management plans, production of maps, emergency 
evacuation plans and specific code of conduct for visitors).  
 
(7) Decision: No final decisions were taken at the Workshop, pending further work and discussion of 
the issue at the CEP and at the ATCM according to established rules of procedure under the 
Protocol. However, it has been agreed in principle that Deception Island would be designated an 
Antarctic Specially Managed Area containing one or more Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and 
Historic Sites and Monuments, with the rest of the island managed by one or more Codes of 
Conduct.25 
 
(8) Implementation and monitoring: The Workshop agreed on a strategy for implementation of the 
Management Plan. An international expedition to Deception Island was proposed by Argentina, to 
verify the management needs and identify sites of scientific and ecological importance, including 
the selection of a site to monitor tourism impacts. The outcomes of monitoring and implementation 
would feedback into the Management Plan development process and aid decision-making. No audit 
recommendations were made at this stage. 
 
The discussion of Deception Island strategic issues aimed at establishing a Management Plan, per se, 
would certainly not allow ATCPs to state that “we are already doing SEA but just not calling it that”.26 
Further, SEA in an Antarctic context may need to address not only issues on the bases of geographic 
location but also considerations concerning technological options, sectors of development, etc. 
Fundamentally, it may need to involve a more substantive normative discussion about what, where and 
why is to take place in Antarctica—and even how much. This discussion would be above and beyond the 
standard EIA considerations of how an activity may take place.  
 
Nevertheless, the steps taken to develop a management plan for Deception Island show that there is a 
need for strategic decision-making in the Antarctic context, and that there are already conditions in place 
to establish ad hoc processes to inform strategic decisions, even if this involves a certain level of 
 
ASOC – Strategic needs and decision-making in Antarctica 
 
11
“trailblazing”. The Deception Island management plan process, whilst it took place within the framework 
established by the Protocol for the establishment of Protected Areas, has two elements that, together, are 
crucial to SEA: 
 
(1) High-level discussion of strategic issues: Whilst the initial discussions for a protected area for 
Deception Island was relatively informal and limited to a few Parties and observers, the final 
management plan for Deception Island would in fact be approved by the CEP and ultimately the 
ATCM. This is in fact a fairly common procedure at the ATS. However in this case it responded to 
strategic needs, explicitly addressed environmental objectives and issues, involved different Parties 
and observers in a common reporting framework, and combined different methodologies to address 
different management and assessment needs. 
(2) Early discussion of strategic issues: The Management Plan process addressed Protocol obligations 
concerning the “…degradation of, or substantial risk to, areas of biological, scientific, historic, 
aesthetic or wilderness significance.”27 It did not respond to a proposed activity, but to future 
developments. The ASMA proposal has come about because the existing uses of the island – 
summer research stations, visitation by tourist ships and yachts, etc. – are likely to continue to grow 
in the foreseeable future. The need for a management plan was triggered by the need to manage 
continuous growth. In effect, the purpose of the ASMA is not only to manage the existing levels of 
human activity at Deception Island, but those that may be reached in a foreseeable future and could 
result in cumulative impacts and conflict of interests among the visitors to the island. 
 
The concept of SEA follows some guiding principles, but the SEA process may have many different 
forms.28  The experience of the Deception Island protected areas workshop suggests that SEA processes 
can be become part of the decision-making procedures in the Antarctic context to address specific 
strategic needs. The processes would need to be developed so that they best meet Antarctic strategic 
needs.  
 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
ASOC hopes that the ATS is willing to discuss strategic environmental needs, including evaluating if the 
objectives and principles of the Protocol are being met effectively and whether they are sufficient in the 
longer term. This may require further integration of existing instruments and decision-making procedures. 
Over the longer term, the principles of SEA could be easily adapted to existing institutions and decision-
making procedures of the ATS. SEA may end up to be less demanding than as first thought.  
 
Based on the theoretical requirements of SEA and practical needs and decision-making processes in the 
Antarctic context, the shape or form that Antarctic SEA would take becomes clearer. 
 
Regarding the application of SEA: 
• 
It would address strategic needs arising from both “traditional” and emerging issues. 
• 
It would often need to manage not just places or activities but also growth and change. 
 
Regarding the SEA process:  
• 
It would be a structured process developed in the context of existing decision-making procedures as 
established by the Protocol (e.g. for CEEs, ASMAs, etc.) and other ATS instruments and modus 
operandi.  
• 
It would require more integration at different levels so that existing instruments and processes work 
better to address strategic environmental issues. Fundamentally it would require more integration at 
the policy level vis a vis the “sustainability” of the Antarctic region. 
• 
It would require taking into consideration underlying issues of the ATS such as sovereignty claims,

without however losing effectiveness in meeting long-term environmental objectives for the Antarctic 
region. 
• 
It would involve new forms of public involvement in addition to those existing at the ATS.  
 
Regarding SEA methodologies:  
• 
It would require a level of abstraction for impact analysis suitably balanced with strategic objectives, 
particularly if details would be further elaborated in a tiered SEA/EIA system (i.e. if activity-specific 
EIA as in Art.8/Annex 1 of the Protocol would follow a strategic-level SEA process). 
• 
It could use methodologies already in use at the ATS (e.g. for environmental monitoring or impact 
assessment) or adopt new methodologies.  
 
There are several arguments that could delay or prevent the ATS from embracing the notion of SEA, 
among these: sensibility to the potential impact of strategic action and decision-making on national 
strategies, difficulty in grasping the concept of SEA, concerns about the supposed complexity of SEA, 
resistance to starting new processes, and the sense that “there is too much to do already” to implement the 
Protocol. This may be the case even though SEA is being developed at the national level of several 
ATCPs for comparable reasons – namely, that environmental objectives will not be met by chance. 
 
Whether strategic decision making processes in an Antarctic context are called SEA or something else is 
not important. What is important is that the strategic environmental needs of a changing Antarctic context 
are addressed effectively. The proposed ASMA at the Deception Island suggests that strategic, process-
based discussions concerning long-term environmental protection are possible within the framework 
established by the ATS and the Protocol. More importantly, they suggest that strategic decision-making is 
necessary—and, arguably, unavoidable—in view of a rapidly changing world and the growing levels of 
human activities in Antarctica, if the objectives and principles of the Protocol are to be met effectively in 
the long term.  
 
ASOC urges the Parties to move forward in developing and testing Antarctic SEA, and suggests that the 
first step is to examine existing strategic processes in the ATS for compatibility to the SEA process.

21 Some authors emphasize the need for informal forms of procedural integration: “Because of the many different views among 
the state parties with regard to the issue of jurisdiction, and because the participants of many Antarctic activities are nationals of 
different states, close cooperation between the competent authorities of all states parties is necessary to prevent private operators 
from misusing the gaps in the various national legislative systems”. Bastmeijer op. cit. p.304.
