Review of Guidelines for the operation of aircraft near concentrations of birds 
 
Information Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by 
the United Kingdom 
 
Introduction 
 
Aircraft provide vital support to modern Antarctic operations and their use is widespread and increasing.  
Concerns have been expressed over the potential effects of aircraft on Antarctic wildlife (Rounsevell and Binns 
1991, Cooper et al 1994).  However, at present there is a lack of clear and consistent guidance available for the 
operation of aircraft close to concentrations of birds.   
 
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty does not provide specific guidance on 
minimum distances for the operation of aircraft near concentrations of birds and seals in Antarctica.  Instead, the 
Protocol stipulates that flying or landing helicopters or other aircraft in a manner that disturbs concentrations of 
birds and seals constitutes ‘harmful interference’, which is prohibited except in accordance with a permit. But 
what constitutes ‘disturbance’ or a ‘concentration’ is not defined.   
 
Review of existing guidelines 
 
A variety of guidelines for the operation of aircraft near to bird populations have been adopted for use within 
Antarctica.  The first formal recommendations are found in the Agreed Measures on the Conservation of Flora 
and Fauna, adopted by Antarctic Treaty Parties in 1964: Article VII prohibited activities likely to cause harmful 
interference with native fauna, such as ‘flying helicopters or other aircraft in a manner which would 
unnecessarily disturb bird and seal concentrations, or landing close to such concentrations (e.g. within 200 m)’ 
(Heap 1994). 
 
Other examples of aircraft restrictions can be found in Management Plans for protected areas.  In 1992 
management plans were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Parties for SPA No. 1 (Taylor Rookery, Mac. 
Robertson Land), SPA No. 2 (Rookery Islands, Mac. Robertson Land), and SPA No. 3 (Ardery and Odbert 
Islands, Budd Coast), with various restrictions on helicopter access.  At SPA No. 1 helicopters may not land 
within 500 m of the penguin colony and overflight is completely prohibited (although, according to the 
management plan map, the designated helicopter landing site is 350 m from the traditional breeding area of the 
emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri)). At SPAs No. 2 and No. 3, where the islands are small, it is 
permissible to land a helicopter within 500 m of the colony ‘only if it can be demonstrated that disturbance will 
be minimal’.  At these sites overflight is allowed only for essential scientific purposes, for which it is prohibited 
to fly below altitudes of 500 m.  At SPA No. 3 there is the additional restriction that overflight must be no less 
than a horizontal distance of 500 metres from the colonies. The site identified as most suitable for helicopter 
landing on Ardery Island is less than 100 m from one of the breeding petrel colonies. At this site it is stipulated 
that helicopter movements should be kept to a minimum during the breeding season of 1 November to 1 April. 
 
Antarctic Treaty Parties adopted in 1997 a revised management plan for Beaufort Island (SPA No. 5), the site of 
breeding colonies of 46,000 pairs of Adélie penguins and approximately 1300 emperor penguins.  The 
management plan prohibits overflight of bird breeding areas lower than 750 m unless it is required for essential 
scientific or management purposes, when transient overflight (such as may be required for aerial census of the 
colonies) may be allowed down to a minimum altitude of 300 m.  The areas within which these restrictions 
apply are shown on maps and extend at a minimum 250 m in horizontal distance from the borders of the 
breeding sites.  
 
In 1999 the Antarctic Treaty Parties adopted a management plan for Svarthamaren (SSSI No. 23), a site 
protected because it contains the largest sea-bird colony on the Antarctic continent and a large proportion of the 
world population of Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica). All overflight and landings within the protected 
area are prohibited, although the recommended helicopter landing site – while outside of the protected area 
boundary – lies within 350 m of the northeastern breeding area of the birds.

The Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM 1995) also contains a number of restrictions on aircraft 
operations close to bird colonies.  The most comprehensive and stringent guidelines are those issued by 
Australia.  It is an offence under Australian law to “fly an aircraft in such a manner as to disturb a concentration 
of birds (more than 20) or seals (more than 10) or by flying, landing or operating a vehicle within 200 m of such 
concentrations” (AFIM 1995: AUS29).  More recently, Australia has issued guidelines governing the use of 
helicopters (Australian Antarctic Division 2000), discouraging pilots from overflying wildlife at any altitude, 
and more specifically prohibiting, without a permit, operation of single-engine helicopters within 2500 ft (about 
750 m) or a twin-engine helicopter within 5000 ft (about 1500 m) horizontally or vertically of wildlife. 
Exceptions are allowed in an emergency or when it is reasonably necessary to do so during the conduct of ship-
shore operations for the purpose of establishing, supplying or maintaining a station. 
 
At Dumont D’Urville station (France), flights are prohibited below 250 m over bird colonies (AFIM 1995: 
DUMONT-3), while at Signy Station (United Kingdom) it is required that all ‘low’ overflights be avoided 
owing to the presence of bird and seal colonies.  The term ‘low’ is not however defined.  Most countries do not 
provide specific guidance on flying heights over bird colonies in the AFIM, suggesting instead that pilots 
‘contact the control tower’ for information on any local flying restrictions. 
 
In the sub-Antarctic islands, a variety of guidelines for aircraft operations have been adopted.  In New Zealand’s 
sub-Antarctic islands, helicopter use is controlled by permits specifying landing sites, overflight and approach 
paths etc. on a case by case basis (NZ Dept of Conservation, pers. comm. 2001). Specifically, helicopter 
landings are prohibited except when necessary for scientific, emergency or other approved purposes provided all 
precautions are taken against endangering or unduly disturbing plant and animal life. As a condition of all 
landings, low level flying within 200 m (assumed both horizontally and vertically) of any bird or seal colony 
during the breeding season is given as a minimum (DoC 1998).  At Australia’s Heard Island, helicopter 
operations are to be undertaken such as to minimise impacts on wildlife concentrations and in accordance with 
the guidelines in force by the Australian Antarctic Division as described in the AFIM above (Australian 
Antarctic Division 1995b).  Similar requirements are outlined in the management plan for the Macquarie Island 
Nature Reserve (Australian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage 1991).   
 
In relation to South African air operations on sub-Antarctic islands, Cooper et al (1994) recommended that 
fixed-wing aircraft should normally avoid overflight below 1000 m vertically and 5000 m horizontally, reducing 
to 500 m vertically for passes required for essential air drops, and reducing further to an unspecified height for 
the drop itself.  It was also recommended that helicopters avoid flying ‘at low altitudes in the vicinity of, or 
approach or land within 500 m of king penguin breeding colonies’ (Cooper et al 1994: 281).  On Gough Island, 
helicopter landings may only be undertaken for scientific or management purposes and must not cause 
‘excessive disturbance to seals and birds’, and landings are not allowed within 200 m of breeding seals and 
penguins (Cooper and Ryan 1993: 29).  Helicopter overflights of seals and breeding penguins are to be ‘kept to 
a minimum’, although specific distance restrictions are not given. 
 
In the recently published environmental management plan for South Georgia (McIntosh and Walton 2000), 
guidance on helicopter use stipulates that overflight and landing are prohibited at all king penguin (Aptenodytes 
patagonicus) colonies at all times; at all albatross colonies during the breeding season; beaches with elephant 
seals during the breeding season; and certain designated fur seal breeding beaches.  Moreover, it is planned to 
develop specific flight path and approach procedures for regularly visited sites.  Flight routes along the coast are 
set at a minimum horizontal distance of 1000 m, and at a minimum altitude of 1000 m above land in those areas 
where overflight is permitted (McIntosh and Walton 2000: 63).  These interim recommendations will be 
reviewed in the light of research being undertaken by BAS scientists on the effects of helicopter overflight on 
wildlife (Stone, pers. comm. 2000).

Experimental evidence on the effects of aircraft operations on Antarctic birds 
 
A number of studies have been conducted on the effects of aircraft on temperate bird species (e.g. Fjeld et al 
1988, Delaney et al 1999).  However, there have been few experimental studies to measure the effects of aircraft 
operations on Antarctic birds.   
 
Studies published thus far have mainly reported observations on only a few species: Adélie penguins (e.g. 
Stonehouse 1963, 1965; Ainley 1983, Culik et al 1990, Taylor et al 1990, Wilson et al 1991, Giese 1996), king 
penguins (Rounsevell and Binns 1991, Cooper et al 1994) and emperor penguins (Kooyman and Mullins 1990, 
Regel and Pütz 1997, Giese and Riddle 1999) (Table 2).  
 
A number of studies have examined the effects of human disturbance on Antarctic penguins (e.g. Wilson et al 
1990, Nimon and Stonehouse 1995, Giese 1996, Fraser and Patterson 1997, Nimon 1997), although only a few 
have made controlled observations or measurements of the effects of aircraft (Sladen and Leresche 1970, Taylor 
et al 1990, Culik et al 1990, Giese and Riddle 1999).  Several studies have considered human impact on other 
species, such as skuas (Hemmings 1990, Young 1990) and southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) 
(Chupin 1997), although these were not specifically concerned with the effects of aircraft.  The latter study 
attributed poor breeding performance among southern giant petrels on Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, to 
low aircraft overflight (in some instances less than 50 m), helicopter activity and other direct human disturbance 
on the ground.

1. 
The strengths of reaction recorded in the different studies are not strictly comparable, and my classification into ‘Minor’, ‘Moderate’ and 
‘Major’ is intended simply as a general guide. Minor is taken as the distance at which birds first showed visible reactions (e.g. neck 
craning, flipper-flapping), Moderate where a large proportion of birds (30%-70%) began more vigorous displays or moving away, while 
Major is where more than 70% of birds began moving away, or many began running or panicked. For specific explanations of the 
reactions of the birds the reader is referred to the papers referenced. 
2. 
Culik et al’s (1990) study focused on measuring heart rates, not behaviour with distance, and thus only their behavioural observations 
are included here. 
3. 
The reaction of the birds was noted for constant flying heights and with varying horizontal distance: the reactions are thus presented 
only in the columns for horizontal distance. 
4. 
Where two distances are given, the first refers to the approach distance at which disturbance was observed to cause this reaction, 
while the second figure is that at which the reaction ceased as the aircraft receded. 
 
Sladen and Leresche (1970) observed the behaviour of Adélie penguins in response to an LH-34 US Navy 
helicopter operating at various altitudes with a ground speed of around 40 knots at Cape Crozier, Ross Island.  
In summary, they observed that when this aircraft operated at altitudes of less than about 500 m over the birds, 
disturbance to their behaviour became ‘moderate’ or ‘great’, which was classified on the basis of the percentage 
of birds exhibiting reactions such as displays or moving from their territories.  These authors recommended that 
a minimum altitude for overflight of Adélie penguins by a helicopter should be 610 m (2000 ft), although they 
acknowledged that even at this altitude there was still some disturbance evident.  They also noted that 
overflights using fixed-wing aircraft (such as a Twin Otter) at the same elevation generally caused less 
disturbance, although controlled observations of fixed-wing aircraft were not undertaken. 
 
Taylor et al (1990) also made observations of the effects of aircraft passes over Adélie penguin colonies during 
preparations for a regular aerial census programme of colonies in the Ross Sea region.  These authors reported 
findings similar to Sladen and Leresche (1970) in relation to helicopter movements.  They also observed 
overpasses by C-130 Hercules fixed-wing aircraft, and did not detect visible disturbance when flying over 300 
m (1000 ft) above the birds, although it should be noted that these observations were themselves made from the 
aircraft. 
 
Culik et al (1990) reported that helicopters approaching within 300-400 m of an Adélie penguin colony caused 
noticeable behavioural responses among the birds, such as running away from the aircraft.  Late in the breeding 
season helicopter activity as distant as 1500 m caused ‘panic runs’ and ‘escape reactions’, even in areas where 
the birds were never approached by the helicopter less than 400 m. 
 
Giese and Riddle (1999) observed creching emperor penguin chicks when they were exposed to two overflights 
by a Sikorsky S-76 twin-engine helicopter at 1000 m.  They reported that all chicks became more vigilant when 
approached by the helicopter (with an air speed 60 knots), and almost 70% either walked or ran, generally less 
than 10 m, toward other chicks.  Most displayed flipper-flapping, which was seldom displayed in the absence of 
the aircraft.  Although the effects were found to be transitory, the authors suggested the results supported the 
“introduction of a more conservative guideline of 1500 m (5000 ft) minimum overflight altitude for helicopter 
operations around breeding localities of this species” (p. 366).

None of the studies that have specifically addressed the problem of effects of aircraft on Antarctic birds may be 
considered comprehensive, and all may be criticised for methodological weaknesses. Only a limited range of 
species, aircraft, environments and conditions have been studied: there remains much work to be done before 
experimental results can provide reliable guidance on the levels at which aircraft may generally operate without 
significantly disturbing bird populations.  There also remains the question of what might be considered 
‘significant’ disturbance. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey have initiated several studies specifically to 
address some of the data deficiencies (Boyd and Trathan; Stone, Shears and Walton; pers comms 2000), 
although results are not yet available.  
 
Interim guidelines 
 
Aircraft will continue to operate, in proximity to concentrations of birds in Antarctica, and pilots should be 
provided with clear and consistent guidelines on acceptable approaches to the operation of their aircraft in these 
contexts.  Guidelines also need to be practical, as over-precautionary approaches have the potential to be 
unreasonably restrictive on air operations, and could severely curtail flight operations or compromise margins of 
safety. 
 
Although there is a need for more empirical data on which to base definitive environmental guidelines for air 
operations in the Antarctic, there remains an immediate need for practical procedures that can be followed.  In 
relation to protected areas, for example, management plans are presently being drafted for numerous sites in 
order to comply with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol.  Specific procedures for access, including air 
access, to the sites need to be written into these plans.  But so far, there has emerged a confusing plethora of 
recommended distances, some of which differ for the same species at different sites.  It would be helpful if there 
was an agreed set of interim guidelines available that could be used in the formulation of these management 
plans, ensuring consistency and enabling more practical implementation by pilots in the field. 
 
Table 3 presents a summary of suggested minimum heights and distances developed after consultation with 
ornithologists and through the process of review of a number of draft protected area management plans as well 
as through informal consultations with the Bird Biology Sub-Group of SCAR.

However, there is clearly a pressing need for further research.  There may also be the need to provide more 
guidance on what constitutes ‘disturbance’ and a ‘concentration’ in the context of Antarctic birds.  In relation to 
‘disturbance’, for example, it could be useful to distinguish between immediate behavioural responses and 
longer-term demographic impacts. 
 
It is hoped that the Antarctic Treaty Parties might find this paper helpful towards eventual agreement of a set of 
practical interim guidelines for aircraft operations close to concentrations of birds in Antarctica. Should a 
practical set of interim guidelines be developed for application in areas where there are concentrations of birds, 
these may prove helpful as a model for further development and adjustment for application to other forms of 
wildlife in Antarctica.
