NOTIFICATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 17 OF THE PROTOCOL ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY 
 
1.1 
Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 
1 and 2, of the Protocol. 
 
The Republic of South Africa has taken the following measures to ensure 
compliance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty: 
 
• Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act (Act No. 60 of 1996) on 1 
November 1996 (Government Gazette, Vol. 376, No. 17536). 
 
• Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act, 1996 (Act No. 60 of 1996), 
Amendment of Schedule 1 of the Act on 16 May 1997 (Government 
Gazette, Vol. 383, No. 17993, Regulation Gazette No. 5926). 
 
The Antarctic Treaties Act came into force on 1 November 1996, and 
presently regulations for further implementation of the Act are being 
developed and it is hoped will be finalized soon. 
 
Operations at the SANAE IV base, Sarie Marais field station, Earth 
Sciences camps, transport routes, Emergency Base, Bukta and on supply 
ships are governed by a Code of Conduct / Environmental Health and 
Safety Management System (EHSMS) shaped by the requirements 
contained in the Environmental Protocol. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 
Contingency plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the 
Protocol 
 
South Africa established an Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the South 
African National Antarctic Programme’s (SANAP) research and supply 
vessel, the mv SA Agulhas, and its Antarctic base, SANAE IV, based on 
the guidelines as set out by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic 
Programmes (COMNAP), which has been effective since 23 October 
1996. 
 
During the 2000/2001 season, a fuel spill larger than 200 litres 
(approximately 1000 litres) occurred, due to a valve malfunction on a 
mobile fuel tanker. Further details are available on request.  Six empty fuel 
tankers on sledges which were lost the previous season when a portion of 
the ice-shelf broke off were replaced during 2000.  
 
Safety training and equipment is continually being upgraded for personnel 
and base operations.

REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX I, ARTICLE 6(1) OF THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL 
 
2.1 
Procedures to consider the environmental impacts of proposed 
activities in Antarctica (Annex I, Article 6 (1a)) 
 
The procedures laid down in Annex I of the Protocol are adhered to by 
South Africa, and a detailed description of the process to be followed is 
incorporated in the Regulations that it is hoped will be adopted shortly. 
 
2.2 
List of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEE) developed in 
accordance with Article 2 and decisions taken (Annex I, Article 6 
(1b)) 
 
During the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 1999, South Africa compiled an 
IEE for the decommissioning of the old SANAE III base. As well as the 
Sarie Marais base at Grunehogna. SANAE III has been fully 
decommissioned and the Sarie Marais base was to be removed in its 
entirety during the 2000/1 season.  Due to time, weather and ships space 
limitations however, the action was only partly addressed (two of nine 
containerised structures removed) and has been re-scheduled for 
completion during the 2001/2002 summer and 2002/2003 season, if 
required.

Report on implementation of Waste Management Plan (Annex III, 
Article 9 (1) of the Protocol) 
 
Since 1991/92, South Africa’s Waste Management Plan has been fully 
implemented and all the waste generated during expeditions are 
separated and categorised according to the Plan and retrograded out of 
Antarctica.  
 
All household waste is sorted into categories of glass, metal, kitchen food 
waste, chemicals, oils and medical waste and are sealed in drums. All 
paper and plastics are compacted into bales and stored in steel orange 
containers. Building waste from the construction phase was loaded into 
plywood and timber crates. The following was back-loaded and returned to
