Review of the List of Historic Sites and Monuments 
 
Working Paper Submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection  
by the United Kingdom 
 
 
 
Introduction and Background 
 
1. The concept of designating Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs) in Antarctica was established 
at the first meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in 1961.  Recommendation I-IX 
urged Governments “interested in any tombs, buildings or objects of historic interest”, to 
exchange information on the status and protection of such items.  At ATCM VII, the matter was 
taken further by the drawing-up of a formal “List of Historic Monuments”.  The list was adopted 
by Recommendation VII-9. 
 
2. Recommendation VII-9 listed 43 sites.  Since then, a further 31 HSMs have been added to the 
list.  The most recent of these is the south-west coast of Elephant Island, HSM number 74.  
Measure 2 (1998) refers. 
 
3. The introduction of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991) 
has provided further options for designating and managing Antarctic HSMs.  Under the 
provisions of Articles 3, 4 and 8 of Annex V to the Protocol, HSMs may be designated as either 
Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs), 
or they may simply be listed. 
 
4. Examples of historic sites being designated as Specially Protected Areas can be found in 
Measure 1 (1998), when ATCM XXII adopted the management plans for three historic huts.∗ 
 
Review of the List of Historic Sites or Monuments 
 
5. Many new sites have been added to the list of HSMs since it was first introduced in 1972.  
However, sites that no longer exist have not been removed, and no thorough review of the list 
of sites has been undertaken by the Consultative Parties. 
 
6. At CEP III the United Kingdom (UK) presented Working Paper XII SATCM/WP4, which 
indicated the need to review regularly the list of HSMs.  The Committee agreed with this 
concept.  However, it was noted that any changes to the List of HSMs may require changes to 
national legislation.   In the light of this, a general review of the complete list was considered a 
more appropriate way to proceed. 
 
7. Members were asked to review the List of HSMs and to provide information to CEP IV and to 
the UK CEP contact.  The UK also undertook to provide a paper to CEP IV on this subject 
(paragraphs 79 and 80 of the Final report of CEP III refer). 
                                                 
∗ The Management Plans for these sites were adopted in the format of Annex V to the Protocol.  However, the sites 
were adopted as Specially Protected Areas under the 1964 Agreed Measures pending the entry into force of Annex V. 
 
 
8. Since then, the UK has received only limited feedback on the issue from other Members of the 
Committee.  Nevertheless, the UK has undertaken an initial consideration of the List of HSMs 
and drawn together key information.  Appendix I lists each of the 74 sites along with their 
respective locations and the Recommendation or Measure by which they were adopted. 
 
9. Appendix I also indicates the Party or Parties that originally proposed each site. This 
information has been derived from papers presented at, or Final Reports of, the ATCMs at 
which the sites were adopted.  This information is summarised by “proposing Party” in 
Appendix II. 
 
Recommendations 
 
10. It is proposed that the information compiled in Appendix I be used by the CEP as the basis for 
a thorough review of the list of HSMs.  In doing so, it is further proposed that the following 
issues be addressed: 
 
• Existence of the site: 
 
It will be important to determine if sites still exist, either in full or in part.  It is known that 
at least four of the listed sites have been lost or destroyed.  It is recommended that such 
sites or monuments should be put forward to the CEP/ATCM for de-listing.  However, 
special consideration may need to be given to sites that have been buried.  For example, the 
cemetery at Whalers Bay on Deception Island. 
 
• Assessment against criteria: 
 
At ATCM XIX (1995) Treaty Parties adopted, by means of Resolution 8 (1995), criteria to 
be used in the selection and nomination of Historic Sites or Monuments – see Appendix III.  
It is recommended that all listed sites be reviewed against these criteria to ensure that they 
conform.  It is recommended that those sites that fail to match the criteria should be put 
forward to the CEP/ATCM for de-listing. 
 
• Site description: 
 
Site descriptions should also be reviewed and, where appropriate, updated.   
 
• Site boundary: 
 
It is also recommended that consideration be given, as appropriate, to identifying 
boundaries for HSMs.  Each site description should clearly state what is included within the 
site and thus what it is that requires protection.  In those instances where boundaries are 
included, site descriptions should include a map clearly showing the extent of the site.  
 
 
 
 
 
• Designation as ASPA or ASMA: 
 
For those sites that require particular management or special protection, consideration 
should be given to de-listing the site and designating it as either an ASPA or an ASMA as 
appropriate. 
 
11.  It is suggested that such a review be initially undertaken on a “proposing Party” basis, i.e. the 
Party or Parties that originally proposed a site for listing should take responsibility for 
reviewing that site (Appendix II refers). 
 
12. However, it is recognised that in some cases the proposing Party may not now be the primary 
interested party.  More recent accessions to the Treaty may require other States to be included 
in (or to assume sole responsibility for) the review of any one site.  An example might be 
Historic Site number 38, the remains of the Swedish explorer, Nordenskjold’s hut on Snow Hill 
island.  This site was proposed jointly by Argentina and the UK in 1972 before Sweden became 
a Party to the Treaty in 1984.  In such situations interested Parties should liaise, to determine 
mutually which would have responsibility for the review.  In addition, the list of sites shown in 
Appendix II will need to be updated to take this into account. 
 
Summary 
 
13. The List of Historic Sites and Monuments has increased since it was established in 1972. 
However, a number of these sites no longer physically exist, yet remain on the list.  It is 
therefore recommended that a thorough review of the List of Historic Sites be now undertaken 
along the lines suggested above to ensure that the list is an accurate and up-to-date reflection of 
the situation. 
 
14. A draft Resolution, to give effect to the recommendations set out in this paper, is attached for 
consideration at Appendix IV.

APPENDIX IV 
 
Draft Resolution .. (2001) 
 
Historic Sites and Monuments 
 
The Representatives, 
 
Recalling Recommendations I-IX, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8; 
 
Noting the desirability of reviewing the List and Historic Sites or Monuments to ensure that it 
remains accurate and up-to-date; 
 
Noting also that on entry into force of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection 
to the Antarctic Treaty, Historic Sites and Monuments may be re-designated as Antarctic 
Specially Protected Areas or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas; 
 
Recommend that: 
 
Those Consultative Parties identified in the Appendix to this Resolution assume 
responsibility for reviewing the listed Historic Sites and Monuments. 
 
In conducting a review of a listed Historic Site or Monument those Consultative Parties 
should assess whether: 
- 
the site still exists either in whole or in part; 
- 
the site continues to meet the guidelines for Historic Sites or Monuments 
set out in Resolution 8 (1995); 
- 
the description of the site should be amended, and updated 
- 
boundaries should be identified for the site.  If so, suitable maps should be 
produced; 
- 
the site requires special protection or management and, if so, whether it 
should be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area or as an 
Antarctic Specially Managed Area; 
- 
in the light of this review, the site should be de-listed. 
 
That the Consultative Parties identified in the Appendix to the Resolution report on the 
outcome of their review to ATCM XXV.
