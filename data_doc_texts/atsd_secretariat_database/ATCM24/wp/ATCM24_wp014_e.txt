Response to Resolution 5 (1999) 
A paper prepared jointly by COMNAP and SCAR 
The Resolution sought advice from COMNAP and SCAR on aspects of the liability 
discussions. This paper deals with the questions posed by ATCM XIII from the perspective 
of  the impacts of incidents, not of planned or ongoing activities. 
 
The paper initiates discussion on these issues.  If the ATCM considers it valuable to take this 
discussion further, SCAR/COMNAP consider a workshop involving legal, operational and 
scientific expertise would be of value.  It is also noted that CCAMLR and IUCN, among 
others, have useful experience that would contribute to determining what levels of impact 
may be judged to cause “harm” and to developing a set or sets of guidelines that may be used 
to assist in making such judgements. 
 
SCAR considers that there are no agreed scientific definitions for any of the terms listed in 
the Resolution since all of them have been developed to deal with cultural or legal 
acceptability rather than scientific proof of a hypothesis.  It is perfectly possible to use 
scientific data and methods to define criteria or levels of change, the potential for repair and 
the degree of linkage or association between ecosystems.  This should provide the basis for 
the development of international guidelines linking the science with practical management.  
SCAR recognizes that this paper makes no attempt to address changes to aesthetic and 
wilderness values.  At the current time, there are no accepted definitions that can be used. 
 
The specific questions raised are answered below. 
 
A) what criteria could be used to determine whether an impact caused harm to the 
environment? 
The terms “harm” and “damage” are not scientific concepts but cultural and legal 
concepts.  They can and have been applied to scientific and environmental problems but, 
because of their origins, they have not been applied in an objective way.  In other words, 
each application has required a subjective interpretation of the term within a particular 
context.  In the context of the liability discussions it is suggested that general usage 
would assume that “harm” is caused by a change in the state of the environment brought 
about by human actions.  Interpretation of scientific data for selected criteria to 
determine whether or not "harm" has been done is subjective.  The impact can be 
primary (e.g. effect of an oil spill on survival of limpets) or secondary (e.g. poisoning of 
birds by eating limpets polluted with hydrocarbons).  In both cases the human induced 
impact can be said to have caused change to the environment but there still remains the 
question of whether or not that change results in harm.  It makes no difference to the 
concept of “harm” whether the impact is accidental or planned. 
 
On this basis many, or even most, human activities in the Antarctic cause some change 
to the environment.  For the purposes of liability or regulation the criteria required are 
those that will provide an indication of the degree of change so that what constitutes 
“harm” can be determined.  For the Antarctic there are at present no agreed criteria to 
distinguish degrees of change other than those derived by CCAMLR to control the 
impacts of fishing.  In this instance the over-riding requirements are to “Maintain the 
 
3 
ecological relationships between harvested, dependent and related populations of 
Antarctic marine living resources” and “To prevent or minimize the risk of changes [by 
fishing] in the marine ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three 
decades”.  Thus the Convention contains requirements to limit impacts to a particular 
level that will not cause long-term change to the marine ecosystem.  It implements this 
through setting catch limits for individual species and monitoring the functioning of 
specific aspects of the marine food web. 
 
There is clearly a need to derive generic scientific guidelines for degrees of change 
resulting from impacts on terrestrial and freshwater systems.  A useful basis on which to 
develop such considerations is the form of agreement already reached to define which 
species have populations that are threatened or whose long-term survival is endangered 
by environmental impacts.  In developing such criteria for birds it has proved necessary 
to define population size and spread, normal natality and mortality, life cycle 
reproductive characteristics and susceptibility to particular forms of impact. 
 
This paper does not list specific criteria that need to be taken into account although the 
examples given provide an indication.  Useful lists of criteria may be found in Abbott,   
S B and Benninghoff, W S.  1990.  Orientation of environmental change studies to the 
conservation of Antarctic ecosystems.  In Kerry, K R and Hempel, G (ed) Antarctic 
ecosystems: ecological change and conservation.  Berlin, etc, Springer-Verlag, 394–403 
and an extract is attached to this paper as Appendix 1. 
B) what is the scientific meaning of “dependent and associated ecosystems”? 
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals viewed within its physical 
environment or habitat.  It is a concept and thus can be applied equally well to an 
individual pond or to the whole world – the key differences being only those of size and 
complexity.  Since all the units of all sizes are connected within the global system all 
ecosystems are associated in some way, whilst some units are primarily dependent on 
other units for their effective functioning.  Again, the requirement from a scientific 
viewpoint is to establish the degree of association or dependence between units and to 
consider what is likely to happen if such relationships are damaged by specific types of 
impact. 
 
Dependence can be because transfers between two ecosystems are crucial to the long 
term functioning of one or both.  For example, without continuing nutrient transfers by 
birds from the marine ecosystem to land ecosystems in coastal continental Antarctica 
most terrestrial communities could not persist.  This is a high degree of dependence.  A 
lesser degree is shown by wandering albatrosses that feed on the coastal shelf of Brazil.  
Whilst for those individuals that choose to feed there we can assume a high degree of 
dependence on a specific locality, for the species as a whole it can only be a low degree 
of dependence as many individuals feed elsewhere. 
 
If used scientifically “association” has also to be qualified.  Specifically it is necessary 
to define what the association or linkage is (e.g. shared species or communities, transfers 
of nutrients or energy) so that some estimate of the significance of the association can be 
made. For example, the ecosystem in the winter sea ice in the Bellinghausen Sea is 
 
4 
clearly associated with the continental shelf ecosystem around South Georgia through 
the continuing provision of a population of krill in the shelf waters around the island. 
 
 
C) What in the circumstances of Antarctica, are incidents that could cause 
environmental harm, distinguishing immediate from gradual or cumulative harm? 
 
COMNAP analyzed the question in two parts: 
 
1. 
What types of incidents could cause environmental harm: 
2. 
How would operators distinguish between immediate from gradual or cumulative 
harm? 
 
The following definitions were adopted in this analysis: 
Incident: 
A time limited unplanned event that results from human 
activity that becomes apparent at a specific point in time. 
Environmental Harm: 
An adverse impact to the natural environment, which is 
significant and lasting. 
Immediate Harm: 
Environmental harm that commences instantly and/or 
inevitably from an incident. 
Gradual / Cumulative Harm: Environmental harm that results from continuous or 
repetitive impact of an incident(s). 
 
The compilation and assessment of types of unplanned incidents that could occur in 
Antarctica from the operation of facilities and the support of research are shown in  
Table 1.  Examples, with possible response action are given in Appendix 2. 
 
Table 1 shows the environments in and around Antarctica in which scientific and station 
operations occur, the transport methods, facility operations, and activities that are 
undertaken to accomplish the objectives of national programs.  The matrix illustrates the 
interrelationship among 132 scenarios that could be encountered during the conduct of 
activities in the course of implementing a national program.  
 
For example, under Transport Systems, aircraft/helicopters are operated in each of the 
location categories, as are vehicles with the exception the vehicles are not operated in 
the Open Sea.  Similarly under Facilities, installation and operation of utilities (power 
and water lines) are limited to Bases/Facilities, whereas the production of sewage/waste 
water occurs at all locations. 
 
These responses do not include consideration of tourist activities; the introduction 
of diseases or foreign organisms; space debris, malicious acts, or global pollutants 
 
Having identified systems, facilities,and activities that make up the range of national 
program activity in Antarctica, the next step is assessing the potential for negative 
impacts on the environment.

Determining Transport Systems, Facilities, and Activities that can result in incidents with the potential for 
negative impacts on the environment: 
 
As an initial task, we identified the Systems/Facilities/Activities that could result in 
incidents and assessed the potential to produce a negative impact on the environment.  
To determine that potential, each Systems/Facilities/Activities was assessed on the 
likelihood that in the course of conducting the work 1) whether an incident could occur, 
and 2) if an incident were to occur, whether that the incident could result in 
environmental harm.   
 
This assessment was done based on a qualitative scale of likelihood as follows: 
negligible (n); possible (p); likely (l); very likely (vl).  As a result each scenario is 
described by two estimates of likelihood, one for occurrence and the other for 
environmental harm.  The likelihood of an incident occurring is compared to the 
likelihood that the incident could result in environmental harm, or: 
 
Possibility of an incident/Possibility of environmental harm 
 
6 
 
The assessment of the likelihood of an incident occurring and the possibility of that 
incident causing environmental harm is subjective, and was based on the collective 
experience and judgement of COMNAP/SCALOP members in addition to the 10 years 
incident reporting of the Antarctic operators evaluated by COMNAP in working paper 
16 submitted to the ATCM XXIII. 
 
Thus conclusions of qualitative likelihood can be summarized as follows: 
• 
There is virtually no environmental harm resulting from ground or air transport incidents or fires.  
These events appear to occur infrequently and when they do the magnitude of the environmental 
impact is insignificant. 
• 
The most common incidents with the potential to cause the greatest environmental harm are fuel spills. 
• 
Most fuel spills in Antarctica are likely to be small and confined to a station or base or the adjoining 
waters and are unlikely to threaten significant concentrations of wildlife. 
• 
Fuel spills in the marine environment have a low probability of occurrence but pose a greater 
magnitude of risk to wildlife than terrestrial or ice sheet spills.  Marine spills in the vicinity of 
rookeries, breeding grounds or primary habitats for marine mammals or birds pose a higher risk than 
marine spills in the open sea or less sensitive areas. 
 
The judgement of likelihood of causing environmental harm consequently presumes that 
spill prevention strategies followed by emergency preparedness and spill response are 
performed according to the COMNAP guidelines.  
 
Determining whether an incident could result in environmental harm: 
 
COMNAP/SCALOP members agreed that an incident could result in environmental 
harm when the incident has a possibility of causing a significant and lasting impact   
Any incident that exceeded that threshold is considered having the possibility of 
resulting in environmental harm. Fourteen scenarios meet or exceed this threshold.  
 
For example, aircraft operating in the coastal zone, the possibility of an incident 
occurring is considered to be possible (light aircraft and helicopters), and should an 
incident occur, it is possible that it could result in some environmental harm.  This 
likelihood is shown as p/p in the matrix.   
 
In another example, ships operating in the coastal zone, because of the threat posed by 
ice bergs and uncharted sea mounts, it is possible that an incident could occur 
(grounding; sinking, etc.), and as a consequence, the possibility that the accident could 
result in significant and lasting impact is considered to be very likely.  This likelihood 
would be described as p/vl in the matrix.   
 
On the other hand, for aircraft operating in the Ice Free Inland areas, the possibility of an 
incident occurring is negligible, but should an accident nevertheless occur, it is possible 
that environmental harm could result.  This likelihood is described as n/p in the matrix. 
 
The scenarios meeting or exceeding the threshold are summarized in Table 2.

Distinguishing immediate from gradual or cumulative harm: 
 
If an incident results in immediate harm, further monitoring would be required to 
determine whether the incident results in gradual or cumulative harm.  Of the 14 
scenarios that could result in environmental harm each is evaluated on whether or not 
the incident could result in gradual, or cumulative harm.  
 
For example, fuel storage at bases and facilities could result in gradual/cumulative harm, 
if for example a leak in storage facilities were undetected or there were a number of 
repetitive leaks until there was environmental harm.  
 
In the example for scientific activities, the likelihood of gradual/cumulative harm is not 
applicable at bases, and facilities because incidents are likely to be contained within 
facilities.  Incidents are also not likely to occur in the coastal zone because of the safety 
precautions taken in travel. While science activities could result in an incident in the ice 
free inland areas where temporary laboratories are established, immediate harm is 
possible, but gradual/cumulative harm is not because an incident would be highly 
localized, and containment measures should be readily available. 
  
The summary of this evaluation is shown in Table 3.  It is important to note that of the 
14 systems/facilities/activities that could result in environmental  harm, only 11 could 
result in gradual/cumulative harm.

Summary: 
 
It must be understood, that this approach is a first order attempt to organize operational 
functions in a way that identifies functions that could result in environmental harm. 
Tables 1 – 3 is a stepwise compilation of systems/ facilities/ activities and an assessment 
based on experience, on the possibility of incurring an incident, and how an incident 
could impact the environment. 
 
The development of the matrixes lead to the identification of systems/facilities/ activities 
that have the possibility of resulting in some environmental harm IF an incident were to 
occur. This in turn allows the operator to further analyze those activities to identify 
preventive measures and contingency response plans.  With preventive measures and 
contingency response plans in place that have been tailored to activities that have the 
possibility of generating incidents, both the possibility of an incident and the possibility 
of inflicting immediate or gradual/cumulative environmental harm is significantly 
reduced.  
 
 
D) Whether, and under what circumstances, would it be possible and/or practicable to 
take containment, mitigation or clean up action, and whether, and under what 
circumstances, would it be possible to restore the environment? 
 
Definition of terms in the question are noted as follows: 
 
9 
Containment: 
To prevent additional risk of harm to the environment by 
preventing the spread of harmful materials as a result of 
an incident. 
Mitigation: 
To decrease the potential of environmental harm through 
containment, recovery, or protection of the environment 
from harmful materials. 
Clean up: 
Removal and recovery of released materials resulting 
from an incident. 
Restore the Environment: 
Return the environment to the condition it was in prior to 
an incident. 
 
Containment and mitigation are considered to be the primary actions that could be taken 
immediately after an incident occurs.  However, before the initiation of any action, there 
must be assessments, first of the risk to safety and life, and second to the practicality of 
any intervention under existing conditions of weather, and environment. 
 
Clean-up and restoration of the environment are considered to be follow-up actions, in 
that these should follow an assessment of whether such action is feasible, cost effective, 
appreciably affect the natural rate of recovery, or will cause more harm than the impact 
of the incident. 
 
There are several very significant qualifications to the ability to take action.  They are: 
• 
that  there are no risks to safety or life; 
• 
that weather conditions are suitable for operations; 
• 
that the event is not catastrophic; and 
• 
that material and resources are available. 
 
Reference is made to the table of incidents that could cause environmental harm (Table 
2).  Each incident that could result in environmental harm was assessed to judge under 
what circumstance containment, mitigation, clean up, or restoration of the environment 
could be undertaken.  For example, in an incident involving a ship at a base or facility, it 
is likely that a resultant spill could be contained, that mitigation measures could be 
undertaken to minimize potential harm, and that clean-up activities could be initiated 
(contain/mitigate/clean-up).  This should be possible at bases and facilities because 
materials and expertise should be available as a consequence of the preparation of 
contingency plans for that type of incident, and that bases and facilities generally have 
the capacity to store and maintain a level of response action.   
 
On the other hand, a fuel storage incident in the coastal zone is problematic because 
containment materials, and response to mitigate an incident are not likely to be readily 
available, or timely. However, once the incident is detected, clean up to some extent is 
likely to be possible (clean up).    
 
Appendix 2 is a summary table of each incident that could result in environmental harm 
and what are the possible response actions.  These are examples of the types of incidents 
that could occur and are used for purposes of illustration.  They are not comprehensive.  
 
Summary: 
 
10 
 
Each operator should construct their own matrixes to reflect their types of activities, 
environments and situations, so that an understanding of the kinds of incidents that can 
occur are identified.   By anticipating potential incidents, appropriate preventive 
measures can be put into place and contingency plans can be developed.  Prior 
preparations will not only significantly reduce the possibility of an incident but should 
an incident occur, the ability to contain and mitigate environmental impact will also be 
enhanced. 
 
In all instances where clean up is reasonable, and taking into account possible adverse 
environmental impacts of clean-up activities themselves, an assessment must be made 
before proceeding with restoration.  Consideration would be made on many factors, 
including feasibility/desirability to conduct restoration considering further potential 
adverse impacts, and consideration of natural rates of recovery and cost effectiveness.  
In many instances, restoration may not be possible in the circumstances presented in 
Antarctica. 
 
 
E) is there an operational or scientific definition of the term “irreparable” and, if so, 
what criteria could be used to determine if harm is “irreparable” 
There is no agreed scientific definition of the term “irreparable” since what can be 
repaired and with what degree of success changes as science and technology develops.  
In the context of the liability discussions and present scientific knowledge we can at 
present say three things: 
1. death of an individual animal or plant must be considered irreparable 
2. destruction of a community must be considered irreparable if repair requires the 
reconstitution of an identical community; if on the other hand repair requires the 
restitution of a similar community then the damage may not be irreparable. 
3. destruction of a habitat must be considered irreparable if repair requires the 
reconstitution of an identical habitat; if the restitution of a similar habitat is 
acceptable the damage may not be irreparable. 
As with previous terms the important practical feature of this approach is the provision 
of agreed criteria on repair; these need to define how closely the repair must match the 
original and over what time-scale a particular level of achievement must be reached.  For 
example, is it adequate to replace one moss community dominated by three species with 
another moss community dominated by a single species?  Or should a relocated colony 
of burrowing petrels achieve the mean annual reproductive level typical of the species 
within the first five years after relocation or within the first 10 years?  Setting criteria for 
both for repair and for determination of success is clearly dependent on the extent of 
scientific knowledge in each case but what constitutes success is a subjective value 
judgement.

are not likely to be noted until the cache is visited

Preventive measures are relatively simple, and  
 
 
 
would minimize leaks to the environment.
