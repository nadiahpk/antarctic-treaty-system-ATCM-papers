IV CEP 
Working Paper WP-23  
Agenda Item 4g) 
Norway 
Original: English 
 
 
Proposal: Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 historic remains in Antarctica 
 
 
 
Background 
1. In WP 20 to CEP II Norway proposed to the Treaty Parties automatic protection as 
a mechanism for protecting yet undiscovered and unrecorded historical artefacts in 
Antarctica. 
 
2. The meeting discussed the proposal thoroughly and the final report from CEP II 
records the following: 
 
(72) Norway introduced Working Paper (XXIII ATCM/WP20) proposing a mechanism for the 
automatic protection of undiscovered and unrecorded historic remains in Antarctica. The 
Working Paper contained a draft Measure. 
 
(73) Several members noted the importance of finding mechanisms for the protection of 
undiscovered and unrecorded historic remains, and endorsed the proposal in principle. 
However, several members also noted concerns regarding the legal aspects of implementing 
such a mechanism, and saw the need to consider further the proposal. It was suggested that 
protection could be provided in a non-mandatory manner (e.g. through a Resolution or through 
a Code of Conduct).  
 
(74) IAATO noted that Recommendation XVIII-1 had, at least in part, already elaborated 
guidelines for visitors to Antarctica with respect to protecting historic remains, and preventing 
the collection and taking away of man-made artefacts and parts or contents of buildings as 
souvenirs. 
 
(75) It was suggested that further work is needed to define the term ‘historic objects’ in the 
Norwegian paper to ensure clarity over what is being considered. It was also suggested that 
the cut-off date for automatic protection should be 1958 so as to include historic remains from 
the International Geophysical Year in such a protection regime. 
 
(76) The Meeting agreed that the issue would be placed on the Agenda of the next meeting of 
the Committee (CEP III) to consider further the matter. 
 
3. Parties should refer back to ATCM XXIII WP 20 for the background discussion 
which provides the basis for the below proposal (available in the CEP website 
document archive). 
 
 
Discussion 
4. Norway recognizes that for various reasons it may be difficult for Parties to 
implement a formal Measure instituting automatic protection of historic remains in 
Antarctica. However, there is now ample precedence in the Antarctic Treaty 
System of implementing conservation measures through guidelines. Norway 
believes that the sincerity of the discussions at CEP II showed that Parties would 
also honour any agreed voluntary guidelines relating to the protection of historic 
artefacts/sites.    
 
5. It is recognized that historic remains (artefacts and sites) is a broad term and that 
further specification/definition may be appropriate in the context of protection of 
undiscovered and unrecorded historic remains. Norway would suggest that the 
term historic artefacts and sites in this context encompass1: 
 
• Artefacts with a particular association with a person who played an 
important role in the history of science or exploration of Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with a particular association with a notable feat of endurance 
achievement; 
• Artefacts representative of, or forms part of, some wide-ranging activity 
that has been important in the development of knowledge of Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with particular technical or architectural value in its materials, 
design or method of construction; 
• Artefacts with the potential, through study, to reveal information or has the 
potential to educate people about significant human activities in 
Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with symbolic or commemorative value for people of many 
nations. 
 
Examples of types of artefacts that may fall in under the above categories include, 
but are not limited to: 
• remains of station or camp sites or any natural shelters with evidence of 
human activity; 
• human made structures of all kinds, and remains or parts of such 
structures, including cairns, crosses and similar monuments; 
• remains of vessels, land vehicles or aircraft; 
• traces of sealing, whaling and fishing activity, and devices associated with 
such activity; 
• rocks and outcrops with inscriptions; 
• graves of any kind, and any human skeletal remains; 
• all loose artefacts with connection to human activity in Antarctica. 
 
6. Norway recognizes the historic value of any remains from the International 
Geophysical Year (IGY) and would amend the proposal from 1999 and suggest 
that it would be important to include unrecorded and undiscovered remains prior to 
and including 1957, in the protection regime proposed below. 
 
7. ATCM Recommendation XVIII (1994) does indeed urge visitors to Antarctica not 
to collect or take away man-made artefacts as a souvenir, including any contents of 
buildings. We do not see a conflict between this already existing provision and the 
proposal put forward herein, rather it is suggested that the following proposal will 
strengthen protection of historic artefacts/sites even further, and give clearer 
guidance to Parties with respect to handling of historic remains as they are 
discovered. 
 
 
                                                 
1 This list is based upon the criteria proposed in the “Proposed Guidelines for the Designation of 
Historic Sites” adopted by the Parties through Resolution 8 (1995). 
 
Proposal 
8. Norway proposes that the ATCM agrees to the Guidelines set out below, which 
would provide guidance to Parties with respect to handling newly discovered 
historic artefacts/sites. A draft Resolution is attached as Appendix 1 to this 
document and is submitted to the CEP for consideration 
 
 
Proposed Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 historic remains. 
 
1. The following definitions pertain to these Guidelines: 
 
a. Historic artefacts/sites in the context of these Guidelines encompass, but are 
not necessarily limited to:  
 
• Artefacts with a particular association with a person who played an 
important role in the history of science or exploration of Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with a particular association with a notable feat of endurance 
achievement; 
• Artefacts representative of, or forms part of, some wide-ranging activity 
that has been important in the development of knowledge of Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with particular technical or architectural value in its materials, 
design or method of construction; 
• Artefacts with the potential, through study, to reveal information or has the 
potential to educate people about significant human activities in 
Antarctica; 
• Artefacts with symbolic or commemorative value for people of many 
nations. 
 
b. These Guidelines pertain to historic artefacts/sites for which the existence or 
present location has not been established. 
 
c. These Guidelines pertain to pre-1958 historic artefacts/sites. If there is 
uncertainty as to the age of a newly discovered historic artefact/site it should 
be treated as a pre-1958 artefact/site until age is established. 
 
2. All pre-1958 historic artefacts/sites in Antarctica should automatically be trated 
with the respect and protection afforded to designated historic artefacts. Before 
pre-1958 artefacts/sites are removed or destroyed Parties shall have due 
opportunity to consider their inclusion into the formal protection arrangements of 
the Protocol on Environmental Protection. 
 
3. Any person/expedition who discovers pre-1958 historic remains should notify the 
appropriate authorities in their home country.  If movable remains are removed 
from Antarctica, these should be delivered to the appropriate authorities in the 
home country of the discoverer.   
 
4. If historic artefacts are discovered during construction activities, all construction 
should preferably cease until the artefacts have been appropriately recorded and 
evaluated. 
 
5. The Party whose nationals have discovered pre-1958 historic artefacts/remains 
should notify the other Treaty Parties about the discovery, indicating what remains 
have been found, where they have been found and when the discovery was made. 
 
6. The historic artefacts/sites should in principle be considered protected until the 
Parties have had due time to consider their inclusion into the established protection 
system of the ATS 
 
7. That three years after the discovery of a new historic artefact/site has been made 
universally known to the Treaty Parties, it shall no longer be considered protected 
unless it has been afforded protection through existing protective measures as 
described in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
 
 Appendix 1 
 
Draft Resolution ___ (2001) 
Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 historic remains 
 
 
The Representatives,  
 
Recalling Recommendation VI-9 which recommend that the Governments adopt all 
adequate measures to preserve and protect from damage the historic monuments 
situated in the Antarctic Treaty area, 
 
Recognising the unique value of all the cultural remains of early exploration of the 
Antarctic continent, and 
 
Noting that increased activity in Antarctica has increased the pressure on historic and 
cultural sites and artefacts not protected by current measures, 
 
Recommend that: 
The Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 historic remains, appended to this 
Resolution, be used by Parties as guidance in questions relating to protection of 
historic remains in Antarctica.  
 
Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 historic remains. 
 
1. The following definitions pertain to these Guidelines:
