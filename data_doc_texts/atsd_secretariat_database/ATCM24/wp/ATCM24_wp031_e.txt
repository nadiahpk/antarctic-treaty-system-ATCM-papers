THE ARCTIC AND THE ANTARCTIC

(Comparative analysis)

The Arctic and the Antarctic are two polar regions that are located at the opposite poles of the globe. For several centuries, mankind has been attempting to discover the natural resources here for the benefit of its development and prosperity. Overcoming the most severe natural conditions, perennial snow and ice, heroism and tragedy of polar travels and of the last investigators of the Arctic and the Antarctic.

This fact has combined into one whole in many respects the activity carried out in the northern and southern polar areas, in the Arctic and the Antarctic, in the perception of people. At our time, polar investigators of both polar areas use similar technologies, methods, equipment and gear while these activities are typically organized by the same state institutions, scientific and production centers.

However, the expansion and detailing of our knowledge on the polar areas has allowed us to determine a number of significant differences between them (for example, such a comparative analysis of the regions was partly performed by the US Antarctic Program in 1996).

A detailed comparison of different geographical, geological, biological, economical, political and legal characteristics of the Arctic and the Antarctic points to their significant difference that allows us to jointly consider these regions only when resolving global rather than regional problems predominantly of a scientific character. The main difference of these regions is their geographical features. The Arctic is the northern area of the Earth including a deepwater Arctic Basin, shallow marginal seas and the adjoining continental parts of Europe, Asia and North America. On the contrary, the Antarctic is the area whose geographic center is the South Pole. It covers the southern polar continent Antarctica, the adjoining islands and ice shelves and parts of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Thus, the Arctic region presents an ocean surrounded by the continents whereas the Antarctic region is a continent surrounded by the ocean. A comparison of the other characteristics of these regions is presented below.

5. POLITICAL - LEGAL FEATURES

- Presence of states in the territory of the                - Presence of states restricted to 
the region including those adjoining                        research stations.

correspondingly of the state borders.

                                                            - Territorial claims held in abeyance by 
                                                            the Antarctic Treaty.

- The legal regime is determined                             - The legal regime is directly regulated 
primarily by the national legislatures of                   by the provisions of international law 
Arctic states and provisions of the                         the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and 
international law of the sea and the                        subsequent international law acts of the
Agreement on Spitsbergen of 1920.                           Antarctic Treaty System.

Thus, the differences between two Polar Regions are much broader than 
their similarities.

A combined discussion of the Arctic and Antarctic issues should hence be 
not of a broad but of a strictly specific predominantly scientific character.
