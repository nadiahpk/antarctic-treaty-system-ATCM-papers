Working Paper on an 
Analysis of IEEs Prepared for Antarctic Operations 
An Update on Progress 
 
Background 
 
The issue of environmental impact assessment has been an important focus of the Council of 
Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) work over the last decade.  Recent 
initiatives within the Antarctic Treaty system and COMNAP, as well as ongoing experience 
in the practical implementation of the Environmental Protocol, have advanced the 
understanding of the issue.   
 
During the eleventh meeting of COMNAP in Goa, India (September 1999), the Antarctic 
Environmental Officers Network (AEON) arranged a workshop with the aim to follow up 
and facilitate discussions on the issue of environmental impact assessment.   
 
The Workshop considered the value of comparing EIAs for similar activities, in similar 
types of environments, and noted that such a comparison could probably only be done for 
IEEs due to the low number of CEEs so far prepared. It was suggested that a number of IEEs 
for similar activities could be compared to enable a better understanding of how the EIA 
process is being implemented.  
 
The workshop recommended that COMNAP consider initiating an analysis of existing IEEs. 
COMNAP endorsed the recommendation.  
 
At the third meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP III) the issue of 
implementation and interpretation of the Protocol provisions on environmental impact 
assessments was discussed. In this context COMNAP offered to conduct an analysis of 
existing IEEs for two or three specified types of activities with the aim of achieving a better 
understanding of how the EIA process is being implemented. The CEP welcomed this 
initiative. 
 
COMNAP has consequently asked AEON to conduct such an analysis. This paper updates 
the CEP on progress made by AEON with the work.  The terms of reference are set out and 
the draft methodology is provided for the information of the committee.  AEON is expected 
to complete the work by the end of 2001 and COMNAP will report back to the CEP at its 
next meeting.

Terms of Reference 
 
The following terms of reference have been developed for the review of IEEs by AEON. 
 
(1) AEON shall conduct an analysis of existing IEEs considering similar types of 
activities assumed to have similar types of impacts on the Antarctic environment. 
The aim of such an analysis is to achieve a better understanding of how the EIA 
process is being used by national Antarctic programs.   
 
(2) The analysis is to cover a set of activities (including the actions1 conducted as part of 
the activity) assumed to have similar types of impacts on similar environmental 
values. 
 
The following actions should be considered for inclusion in the analysis: 
 
• construction of a station living facility 
• bulk fuel storage 
• scientific ice core drilling 
 
Variations in both the abiotic and biotic environment should be taken into 
consideration when conducting the analysis for the various actions. 
 
(3) The analysis should take into account a representative sample of IEEs. To identify 
relevant IEEs prepared, the updated list of IEEs maintained by the CEP should be 
used as a basis, although further information should be obtained through direct 
contact with the members of the network. 
 
(4) The following aspects should be compared in the analysis: 
 
• description of the activity and the local environment 
• the identification and evaluation of impacts and the methodologies used 
• alternatives to the proposed activity and recommended mitigation  
measures 
• the level of information and detail provided 
• the conclusions reached  
 
(5) The following timeframe has been set for the work: 
 
• Prepare a preliminary report on the ongoing work to CEP IV 
• Complete the analysis by the end of 2001.Methodology Considerations 
 
A working group has been set up by AEON to progress the EIA analysis under the terms of 
reference.  There are eight members of the group.  The group have researched relevant 
                                                 
1 Action: any step taken as a part of an activity (adapted from CEP 1999 Guidelines for Environmental 
Impact Assessment in Antarctica). Activity: an event or process resulting from (or associated with) the 
presence of humans in the Antarctic, and/or which may lead to the presence of humans in Antarctica. 
(adapted from SCAR/COMNAP 1995/96 Monitoring Workshop)

aspects of EIA practice elsewhere in the world, in particular the development of techniques 
to review or assess the quality of the EIA.  Some of these techniques have been useful, for 
instance the effectiveness review developed as part of the International Study of the 
Effectiveness of Environmental Assessment, the purpose of which “is problem-solving 
rather than fault-finding”.  Other reports have also been useful (see references).   
 
From the review criteria which are available, several items are recurrent.  These focus on the 
adequacy of certain aspects of EIA including: 
• A clear description of the proposed activity, its objectives, the environmental setting, 
and a balanced summary of the key issues 
• Adequate and relevant information on environmental effects (long term and short 
term, indirect and direct, negative and beneficial, cumulative, covering all relevant 
environmental media – soil, water, air etc) 
• A sound methodology for assessing the level of impact 
• Provision for monitoring 
• Consideration of alternatives 
 
Two areas of frequent consideration that are beyond the scope of this investigation are 
consultation and outcomes.  Most criteria for consultation from other countries are not 
directly transferable to the Antarctic context owing to the lack of an indigenous or 
permanent population, and the absence of a requirement to consult at IEE level. Several 
studies and reviews of EIAs have used the impact of the EIA on the actual project outcome 
as a measure of their effectiveness. This also relates to auditing and monitoring once the 
activity commences.  The terms of reference for this work relate specifically to evaluation of 
EIA documents themselves, but evaluation of their further implementation and outcomes 
may be a useful future focus. 
 
 
Proposed Process  
 
The AEON working group has developed a process for analysis of IEEs as set out by the 
terms of reference.  The basic elements of the process is as follows: 
 
• 
The analysis will be undertaken by a small panel of reviewers (members of the working 
group). 
• 
Each IEE is reviewed by the panel using agreed criteria set out in the form of a 
spreadsheet (see draft attached). 
• 
The results of the reviews are collated into a matrix table for comparison and 
presentation of the review outcomes.  The draft report is circulated for consideration and 
comment by the working group.  
• 
The final report is provided to COMNAP following input and comments from the 
working group and AEON. 
 
Next Steps 
 
The next steps for the AEON working group will be to finalise the methodology and 
identify the IEEs which will be included in the analysis.  It should be emphasised that 
the actual IEEs that are reviewed will not be identified in the report of the working 
4 
group.   
 
The results of the analysis will be provided to COMNAP who will report back to the 
next CEP meeting on the outcomes and findings.   
 
Recommendation 
 
That the CEP IV provides feedback to COMNAP/AEON on the terms of reference and 
methodology proposed in this paper.
