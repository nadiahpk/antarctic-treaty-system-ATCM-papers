POST-CONFERENCE TOUR TO ANTARCTICA

Delegates will recall that earlier this year the New Zealand Government invited one member of each Delegation to the Seventh Consultative Meeting to participate in a tour to Antarctica after the conclusion of the conference.

The party will be led by Mr Charles Craw and will travel to Christchurch from Wellington on Saturday, 11 November and to Antarctica on Monday, 13 November 1972. The following delegates have accepted the New Zealand invitation:

Lt Commander Jorge Busico        Argentina
Dr R.I. Garrod                   Australia
Mr Alfred van der Essen         Belgium
Mr Mario Poblete                Chile
Mr Georges Rochiccioli          France
H.E. Dr Edvard Hambro           Norway
Mr F.C.L. Loots                 South Africa
Dr E.I. Tolstikov               U.S.S.R.
Dr Brian Roberts                United Kingdom
Mr James E. Heg                 United States of America

Mr R.B. Thomson, Superintendent of the Antarctic Division of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and Mr T.C. Baker, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will accompany the party. Mr V.I. Khamanev will act as interpreter for Dr Tolstikov.

In Antarctica the party will be accomodated at Scott Base and will visit McMurdo, Pole, Vostok and Vanda Stations. It will travel to Antarctica in a New Zealand aircraft; and within Antarctica and on the return journey in U.S. aircraft.

It is scheduled to return to Christchurch on Saturday 18 November.

Full details of the itinerary have been conveyed to those taking part in the tour.
MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT RESULTING
FROM AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITIONS

1.      Introduction

The general impact of man on the Antarctic Environment has 
been covered in SCAR document relating to Antarctic Treaty 
recommendations VI - 4.    The following paper refers only to 
Australian experiences and practice.

Australia maintains three stations on the Antarctic conti-
nent, and a number of small field huts or caravans as refuges 
around each.    Two forward stations for summer operations are 
also maintained in the Prince Charles Mountains.    Traverses 
and aircraft flights are undertaken from the stations.    Dog 
sledge journeys are made on the sea-ice and formerly were made 
inland in some areas.    As a result of these activities Australian 
Expeditions therefore may have had significant localised effects 
on the Antarctic Environment.    These are considered below:

2.      Physical alteration to the environment

Such activities as construction and siting of buildings 
and roads, the use of transport and explosives, have caused only 
small localised changes to some of the rock terrain on which our 
stations are located.

3.      Pollution

The amount of cargo taken to Antarctica by Australian 
expeditions averages about 2,000 tonnes per annum and of this 
amount an estimated 175 tonnes of solid waste is produced and 
some 400 tonnes of fuel is burnt.    Approximately 2,000 tonnes of 
domestic liquid waste is generated.    The amount of waste of 
various kinds at the Australian stations in Antarctica and at 
Macquarie Island in the sub-Antarctic and methods for their 
disposal are sho?n in an attachment to this short report.    In 
summary, the bulk of the solid waste is dumped on to the sea-
ice and the liquid is dishcarged into the sea.    The noticeable
.../2
effect is to create an accumalation of oil slicks on the rocks,
oil drums on the surrounding islands and garbage at the water's
edge.  The effects on the marine ecosystems have not yet been
determined.  Inland the garbage is dumped randomly along our
traverse routes.

4.  Introduction of alien species

No evidence exists that alien species apart from dogs have
been introduced by the Australian Expeditions.  However, no
special measures have been taken to prevent the introudction of
small organisms that may be fortuitously associated with our
goods, personnel or dogs, other than those laid down for dogs in
the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and
Flora.  Similar comments apply to translocation of species with-
in Antarctica.

5.  Disturbance to indigenous species

(a) Birds

Station activities have resulted in the local reduction
of Snow Petrels and Wilson's Petrels.  Aircraft flying
over penguin rookeries have caused widespread but short
term desertion of nests with resultant chick and egg
fatalities.  Visits to breeding colonies may have
resulted in the reduction of some species, but the
evidence is inconclusive.  Some Adelie penguins
(estimated at about 190 per annum) die through wandering
into the lines of chained dogs.  Dogs have occasionally
escaped with unknown consequences.

(b) Seals

In earlier years, up to 115 seals per annum, mostly
Weddell, have been killed in the vicinity of the stations
for dog food.  More recently however, the use of dog
pemican and the reduction of the number of dogs have
.../3
- 3 -

reduced progressively the number of seals required to
around 25 at the present time.

(c) Lichens and Mosses

Station activities also have damaged lichen and moss
communities in the vicinity. Downdraft from heli-
copters has been observed to do considerable damage to
certain of these species (mosses and raised lichens).

The disburbance to indigeneous species is confined to
limited discrete areas, e.g. around stations, field huts or
routes.  In general it is believed to be small and to have no
significant effect on overall populations.  Nevertheless, con-
sideration is being given to measures designed to reduce dis-
turbance to a minimum.
