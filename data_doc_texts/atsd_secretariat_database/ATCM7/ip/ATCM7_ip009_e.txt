TO ALL DELEGATIONS:

CO-HOSTED RECEPTION

During the third preparatory meeting for this Conference, 
it was informally suggested by the Chilean delegation that the
11 nations co-host one reception.  During the fourth preparatory
meeting, plans for this reception were completed.  By now, all 
delegates should have received invitations to this reception.

In order to reduce the length of the reception line, it 
has been suggested that each delegation select one member of 
their delegation to act as that nation's host.  This could 
either be the head of the delegation or the head of the working 
party.  We would appreciate it if each delegate would advise the 
Secretariat of whom will represent their delegation.

Costs for this reception will not be fully known until 
after the reception, with the final amount depending on the 
actual cost of drinks.  If possible, we would like to bill each 
of the 11 nations after all the costs are known.  We have 
estimated that the costs per delegation would be approximately 
$90, but it may well be less than this. Some nations are not 
represented by an Embassy in Wellington.  We would, therefore, 
appreciate it if all delegates could indicate to the 
Secretariat how they wish to be billed for their share of the 
costs of this reception.
