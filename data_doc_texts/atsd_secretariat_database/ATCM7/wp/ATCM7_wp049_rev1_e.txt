ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA OF COUNTRIES NOT CONTRACTING PARTIES

(Text proposed for inclusion in the Final Report - submitted
by the Drafting Committee of Working Group I)

The Representatives, during their deliberations, considered
the question of possible substantial or continuing activities
or territorial claims in the Antarctic Treaty Area by States
that are not Contracting Parties to the Treaty.

They agreed that, in the circumstances, it would be advisable
to consult with one another in conformity with the provisions of
the Treaty, and to invite, if necessary, the State or States
concerned to accede to the Treaty, pointing out the rights and
benefits they would receive and also the responsibilities and
obligations of Contracting Parties.

They recalled the purposes and principles of the Treaty,
and in particular that Antarctica should be a zone of peace and
scientific co-operation and should not become the scene or object
of international discord.  In this connection they drew attention
to the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty.
