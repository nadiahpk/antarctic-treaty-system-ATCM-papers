ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

(Draft Recommendation prepared by the Telecommunications Working
Group for consideration by Plenary)

The Representatives,

Considering the contribution to Antarctic radio propagation
and ionospheric studies made at the SCAR Symposium on "Scientific
and Technical Problems Affecting Antarctic Telecommunications"
held in Sandefjord, Norway in May 1972 and the Interim Report of
the SCAR Group of Specialists (Revised 25 August 1972);

Recognising the need for improving, as far as practicable, the
transmission of information between stations within the Antarctic
Treaty Area and between those stations and the rest of the world;

Bearing in mind that difficulties may arise in Antarctic
communications if new methods of transmission are accepted by
Consultative Parties without due regard to the principle of
compatibility both between new systems and between new and
existing systems;

Recommend to their Governments:

1.      That their offices administering Antarctic programmes
take into account the information presented at the SCAR
Symposium when considering new means of improving
Antarctic communications. Techniques brought to the
attention of representatives by SCAR and others included
communications satellites, VHF low power scatter
systems, oblique ionospheric sounding, coding and error
correcting devices and the wider use of ionospheric
prediction services, especially with regard to short-
term advice on impending disturbances;
2.


2. That their offices administering Antarctic programmes be 
encouraged to exchange information about changes contem-
plated in types of equipment or methods in order to 
improve, where practicable, compatibility between 
Antarctic networks.
