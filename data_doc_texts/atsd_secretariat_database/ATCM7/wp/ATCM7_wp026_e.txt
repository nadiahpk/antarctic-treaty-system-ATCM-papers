CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT
(Draft Recommendation by South Africa)

The Representatives

Recognising that the relative inaccessability of many regions
of the Antarctic Continent create special transport
problems;

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international
co-operation in scientific investigation in Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments

1.  that they accept the principle of using common transport
    facilities by sea and by air for scientific and other
    personnel proceeding with their equipment to and from
    Antarctic stations;

2.  that they encourage bilateral or multilateral exchanges
    between Contracting Parties to establish when such sharing
    of transport facilities would be mutually convenient and
    practicable;

3.  that those Contracting Parties which make use of shared
    transport facilities shall also accept responsibility
    for an equitable share of the costs of such transport.
