CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT
(Draft Recommendation)

The Representatives,

Recognising that the relative inaccessability of many
regions of the Antarctic Continent create special transport
problems;

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international
co-operation in scientific investigation in Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments:

1.  That they accept the principle of using, where
appropriate, common transport facilities by sea and by
air for scientific and other personnel proceeding with
their equipment to and from Antarctic stations;

2.  That they encourage bilateral or multilateral arrange-
ments between Contracting Parties to establish when
such sharing of transport facilities would be mutually
convenient and practicable;

3.  That the cost of shared facilities be met by
arrangement between the Contracting Parties concerned,
either by direct payment, by reciprocation in kind, or
by other mutually agreed means.
