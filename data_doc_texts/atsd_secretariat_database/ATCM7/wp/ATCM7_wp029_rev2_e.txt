MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
(Draft Recommendation)

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations III-VIII and VI-4;

Noting the information provided by the Consultative
Parties about the implementation of "Agreed Measures on the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora";

Considering that there is a need to strengthen the
protection of the Antarctic environment;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They take note of the responses by SCAR to
paragraph 1 of Recommendation VI-4 and that
they discuss these responses in detail at the
Eighth Consultative Meeting;

2. They consider adopting as far as feasible and
practicable, and subject to other international
arrangements and advice, these responses of SCAR
as voluntary guidelines for the conduct of their
expeditions and stations;

3. They encourage SCAR, through their national
committees, to continue its interest in this
matter.
