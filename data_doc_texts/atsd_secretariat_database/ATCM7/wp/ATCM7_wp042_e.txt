THE USE OF RADIOISOTOPES BY FRANCE FOR                   
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ANTARCTICA                        

An isotope generator (ISOTAAF 1), whose source            
is strontium 90 (15,000 curies), has been in              
operation at the Dumont d'Urville base since             
1972, providing the energy for an automatic              
registering station (TBF) linked by wireless             
beam to the main base.

A neutron probe equipped with a 50 mCi radium            
beryllium source is used for measuring the               
density of the snow and the ice.

Radioactive tracers are not used, and their              
use is not at present envisaged.
