SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS
(Draft Recommendation submitted by New Zealand, South Africa
and the United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Recalling:

(1) Recommendation III-X which encouraged SCAR to continue
its interest in and prepare reports from time to time
on the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;

(2) that Recommendation VI-8, has notably increased the
protection afforded to Specially Protected Areas by
prohibiting entry into them except in accordance
with a permit;

Recognising that the existing Specially Protected Areas
were designated under less strict provisions regarding entry;

Noting the need to review whether, in the light of
experience, the existing Specially Protected Areas are ful-
filling the purposes for which they were designated;

Having considered the report produced by the Twelfth Meeting
of SCAR on the "purposes and designation of Special Areas";

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees,
to review and make recommendations about the existing
Specially Protected Areas and to propose such
additional Areas as they may consider desirable.
The series of Specially Protected Areas of out-
standing scientific interest should include:

(a) representative examples of the major Antarctic
land and freshwater ecological systems;
2.


(b) areas with unique complexes of species and any 
areas which are the type locality, or only known 
habitat of any plant or invertebrate species, or 
which contain specially interesting breeding 
colonies of birds or mammals;

(c) areas which should be kept inviolate so that in 
the future they may be used for purposes of 
comparison with localities that have been disturbed 
by man.

2. The number of Specially Protected Areas should be kept to 
the minimum that will meet the criteria set out in para-
graph 1.

3. The size of each Specially Protected Area should be the 
minimum required to serve the purpose for which the Area 
has been designated.
