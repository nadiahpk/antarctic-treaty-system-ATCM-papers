CONSERVATION OF FAUNA AND FLORA

(Extract from SCAR Bulletin No.41, May 1972,
submitted by United Kingdom)

Seals and Birds killed and captured in the Antarctic Treaty
Area, 1964-69)

Prepared by R.M. Laws* on behalf of SCAR
(MS received 7 February 1972)

This analysis is based on statistics provided under Article
XII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna
and Flora+. A summary of the returns of mammals and birds killed
or captured in the Treaty Area, 1964-69, is presented in Tables 1
and 2. No returns have been made from Zone 6, and birds and seals
captured and subsequently released are not included. In the
analysis by area, the zones correspond with those used by the
International Whaling Commission. In relation to seals, they were
first introduced in the Interim Guidelines for the Voluntary
Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing, proposed in 1966 and
extended in 1968. They were later incorporated in the Draft
Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing
(Annex II to the Report of the Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting). The zones are designated by these longitudes.

Zone 1 Between 60° and 120°W
Zone 2 Between 0° and 60°W, together with that part of the
         Weddell Sea lying westward of 60°W
Zone 3 Between 0° and 70°E
Zone 4 Between 70° and 130°E
Zone 5 Between 130°E and 170°W
Zone 6 Between 120° and 170°W

For convenience, these sealing zones have also been used to 
indicate the areas in which the birds were taken.  In some cases 
it was not clear in which of two zones animals were taken, and 
this circumstance is shown in Table 1.

For three species of seals, permissable annual catches have 
been proposed, and the results for these species are summarised 
below.

                    Permissible  Average annual
                     annual catch  catch reported
Crabeater Seal Lobodon carcinophagus   200 000       250
Leopard Seal Hydrurga leptonyx         15 000        28
Weddell Seal Leptonychotes weddelli    10 000       179
Combined                               225 000       457

In the five years 1964-69, 2 373 seals were reported taken, 
an average of 474 a year.  The trend in numbers of seals taken 
since 1965-66, shown by Table 2, is not real.  An examination of 
the returns by countries shows these results.

               1964-65  1965-66  1966-67  1967-68  1968-69
Expected returns   10       11       10       10       10
Actual returns      3        4        6        6        6

The relatively high numbers recorded for 1964-65 in Zone 2 
are caused by 861 seals killed by an exploratory sealing 
expedition, which operated in the area bounded by lat 58° and 
62°S and long 35° and 55°W (Øritsland, 1970).  About 46 per cent 
of these seals were taken north of lat 60°S (Øritsland, personal 
communication), but they are included here because the stock 
involved is the same.

There has been an improvement in the number of returns and 
in their quality, and quite large numbers may have been taken 
but not reported.  For example, several hundred seals have been 
taken annually in Zone 1, but they are reported fully only from 
1968-69.  Some countries have made no returns.  Thus, the totals 
for the different seasons are not comparable, and the true mean 
figures are probably closer to the 1968-69 values.  Nonetheless, 
the results are an insignificant fraction of the permissi%
E.

catches even if there is considerable under-reporting and, now 
that the initial reporting difficulties have been resolved,
returns can be expected to be more complete in future.  It is 
desirable that the countries that have no information to report 
should indicate this fact formally.

The returns also indicate that 1 212 birds have been taken,
an average of 242 per year.  The taking of 3 651 eggs (mainly from
the Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae) is reported, an annual
average of 730 per year.

Clearly there is at present no serious direct threat to
Antarctic seals and birds, although one cannot rule out the
possibility of restricted over-exploitation of some local
populations of seals.
