ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA OF COUNTRIES NOT CONTRACTING PARTIES

(Statement proposed to be included in the Final Report -
submitted by Belgium)

The Representatives, during their deliberations, considered
the question of possible activities in the Antarctic by Powers
that are not contracting parties to the Treaty.

They agreed that it would be advisable for each of their
Governments to invite these Powers to join the Treaty,
emphasising how greatly their presence among the Contracting
Parties is desired and bringing to their notice all the positive
advantages they would receive through joining, as far as their
scientific activities are concerned.

They recognised, however, that if these Powers do not
indicate an intention to join the Treaty but assert sovereignty-
claims in Antarctica, the latter could not be recognised by the
Contracting Parties, pursuant to the provisions of Article IV(2).
Similarly, if these Powers assert sovereignty-claims and then
join the Treaty, the Representatives consider that such claims
would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of Article VI(2)
and could not benefit by the provisions of Article IV(1,a).
