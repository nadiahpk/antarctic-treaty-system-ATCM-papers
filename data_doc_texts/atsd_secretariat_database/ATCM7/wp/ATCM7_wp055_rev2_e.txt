CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT

(Draft Recommendation)

The Representatives,

Recognising that the relative inaccessability of many regions 
of the Antarctic Treaty Area creates special transport problems;

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international 
co-operation in scientific investigations in that area;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They accept the principle of using, where appropriate, 
common transport facilities by sea and by air for 
scientific and other personnel proceeding with their 
equipment to and from Antarctic stations;

2. They encourage bilateral or multilateral consultations 
between Contracting Parties in order to establish when 
arrangements for such common use of transport 
facilities would be mutually convenient and practicable.

3. The cost of the use of any common transport facilities 
should be arranged by agreement between the Contracting 
Parties concerned, either by direct payment, by 
reciprocation in kind, or by other mutually agreed 
means.
