TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA
(Draft Recommendation by U.S.S.R.)

The Representatives,

  Recognising the necessity of expediting the exchange of
meteorological information between the stations in the Antarctic

Considering Recommendation VI - I:

  Supporting the opinion of the participants of the Symposium
on Scientific and Technical problems of telecommunications in the
Antarctic (held in Oslo, Norway, May 1972) concerning the necess-
ity of improving radio transmission between the Antarctic stations
of the Consultative Parties;

  Noting, that short-wave transmission will remain the principal
means of communication in the Antarctic for a long period of time;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They encourage the systematic exchange of data on the
ionosphere and on shortwave transmission in the
Antarctic

2.  They support the introduction and wider acceptance of
angle probing of the ionosphere which permits the
selection of the best possible radio frequencies;

3.  Through their National Antarctic Committees they request
the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research to
organise through SCAR the exchange of scientific inform-
ation related to Antarctic telecommunications and to
solve the technical problems relating to the development
of scientific work on angle probing of the ionosphere.
