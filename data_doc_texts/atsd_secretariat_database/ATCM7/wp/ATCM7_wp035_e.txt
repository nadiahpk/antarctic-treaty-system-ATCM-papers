EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION
(Draft statement for inclusion in Final Report of the Seventh
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting proposed jointly by
Australia, Belgium, France, New Zealand and United Kingdom.)

1.  Representatives of the twelve governments attending the
Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting have noted that
the amount of information exchanged annually between their
governments in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty
is increasing.  They have noted that the Scientific Committee
on Antarctic Research (SCAR) also exchanges information on
matters relating to the planning and results of scientific
research.

2.  Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty specifies the exchanges
which are primarily related to promoting the objectives and
ensuring the observance of the provisions of the Treaty.
Article III.1(c) makes possible the exchange of scientific
information freely and directly between scientific
organisations.  Subsequent Recommendations have added to or
specified in greater detail the content of these two kinds of
exchange.  Direct exchanges between scientific organisations
are covered by Recommendations I-I, I-II, I-III, I-IV and II-I.
Exchanges through diplomatic channels are elaborated in
Recommendations I-VI, I-VII, I-XIII, II-IV, III-I, III-II,
IV-19, IV-20, IV-23, V-2, VI-2, VI-3, VI-6, VI-7, VI-9, VI-12
and VI-13.

3.  Representatives noted that the collection and subsequent
distribution of this information has not always worked
effectively.  They consider that the whole subject needs
review with regard to the possibility of drawing together in
a single Recommendation of the Eighth Consultative Meeting
all the exchanges required through diplomatic channels.
