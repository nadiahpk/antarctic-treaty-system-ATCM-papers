TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA
(Draft Recommendation by the United States of America)

The Representatives,

Recognising the difficulties which attend Antarctic
communications;

Taking into account the growing need for improved methods
of communication and data transmission in Antarctica;

Noting that a wide variety of technical developments are
available to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability
of communications with and between stations and field parties
in Antarctica;

Recognising that operators have a great deal to contribute
to the understanding of Antarctic communications problems;

Considering the views and advice from SCAR and appreciative
of the study and effort of that organisation toward the definition
and solution of communications problems in Antarctica;

Recalling the provisions of Recommendation IV-24;

Recommend to their Governments that telecommunications
experts from their national offices administrating Antarctic
programs co-operate in:

1.   Investigating technological possibilities for improving
     inter and intracontinental communications services in
     Antarctica;

2.   Preparing an operators' handbook to include technical
     guidance for efficient Antarctic communications and a
     digest of the frequency and schedule information avail-
     able through the Exchange of Information;
2. 
3. Achieving agreement on coding and error-correction 
techniques to be employed in the operation of High 
Frequency (HF) and teleprinter links in Antarctica;
4. Studying the possibilities for improvement of Antarctic 
ionospheric prediction information with special emphasis 
on the prediction of impending disturbances.
