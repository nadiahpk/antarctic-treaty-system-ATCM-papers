HISTORIC MONUMENTS IN ANTARCTICA

In addition to the monuments listed in document 
ANT 9/Rev.1 of 6th Consultative Meeting, Norway hereby 
requests that the Betty Cairn, built by Roald Amundsen 
on January 6, 1912 on the Betty Mountain (Lat. 85¹0'S, 
163°W) on his way back from the South Pole be included in 
the list.

Furthermore, Norway requests that the two following 
monuments also be included:

1.  The Church Yard at Reception Island (Lat. 62° 
    59'S, 60° 34" W) where 10-20 Norwegian whalers 
    were buried mainly between 1920 and 1930.

2.  The hut with a memory plaque at Peter Island, 
    built by the Norwegian Nils Larsen in February 
    1929 at Framnaesodden (Lat. 60° 50'S, 90° 30' W), 
    if the hut is still standing.  The memory plaque 
    has the text "Norvegia-ekspedisjonen 2/2 1929".

Finally Norway also proposes that item 38 on the existing 
list should read the following:

Stone hut on Paulet Island built in February 1903 by 
the Norwegian Captain C.A. Larsen of the wrecked vessel 
"Antarctic" etc.
