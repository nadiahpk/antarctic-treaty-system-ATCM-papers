CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT - AIRBUS
(paper submitted by U.S.A.)

An International Air Transportation System
In Antarctica

The concept of an international Antarctic air transportation
system has been advanced a number of times.  Statements concerning
a continent-wide transportation network (airbus system) were set
forth in two recent articles; "Logistics in relation to future Antarc-
tic scientific research" 1 by Dr Gordon de Q. Robin and "International
co-operation in Antarctica-- the next decade" 2 by Philip M. Smith.
The purpose of this working paper is to present the objectives and the
concept of an international air transportation system in Antarctica,
review its advantages for scientific research, and discuss inter-
national pooling and scheduling of some national logistic resources.
Although this plan was drafted in the United States, the ideas here
benefit from discussions held with colleagues from other nations
engaged in Antarctic work.  This, therefore, is a working paper
intended to stimulate further discussion of the subject.

Objectives and Concept

The objectives of an international Antarctic air transportation
system are:
(a) to facilitate research by providing access to all parts of
Antarctica throughout the austral summer for scientists and technical
experts from all nations working in Antarctica;
(b) to provide inter-continental transportation during the austral
winter to (at least) selected locations on the continent; and
(c) to enhance co-operation among the nations signatory to the
Antarctic Treaty.  These objectives are to be realised through

a pooling and common scheduling of aviation resources.   The LC-130 
Hercules and effective short range ski-equipped aircraft such as 
the Havilland Twin Otter have revolutionised air travel through-
out the vast expanses of Antarctica.  Whereas weeks and often 
months were required to travel by dog sled, tractors, and snow 
vehicles from one point to another, and additional months were 
consumed in travel to the continent of Antarctica, hundreds of 
miles can now be spanned in hours, with passengers and cargo 
warm and sccure within the aircraft.  The experience of recent 
years has demonstrated the special intracontinental versatility 
of the LC-130 Hercules, which operates not only from prepared   
landing areas but also from unprepared "open field" locations on 
the icecap, placing scientists and their camps in remote areas. 
This flexibility has attracted many experts in various fields who 
previously were unable to work in Antarctica owing to the large 
time requirements involved in gaining access to data.  With the 
already strong international interests in Antarctic co-operation 
and common scientific goals, the concept of an Antarctic air 
transportation (airbus) system could provide the catalyst for 
greater international co-operation and prosecution of common 
scientific goals.

The outer terminals to Antarctica within the present aircraft 
capability are Christchurch--New Zealand, Punta Arenas--Chile, 
and several airfields in southern Argentina.  South Africa and 
Australia also serve as "jumping off" points but flight facilities 
at the Antarctic end, terminal weather forecasting, and other   
considerations have limited the development of the South African-
Antarctic and Australian-Antarctic airlinks.

From New Zealand, the entry into Antarctica is through the 
United States station at McMurdo Station, where extensive facili-
ties are available to receive and maintain aircraft, both wheeled 
and ski-equipped.  McMurdo also can house and subsist incoming 
passengers and handle cargo.  The station is presently the only 
station in Antarctica with this complete a range of services.

The other intercontinental approach presently available is 
from South America, with flights terminating at Seymour Island 
(64°17'S 56°45'W) on the Antarctic Peninsula.  The present   
facilities on Seymour Island are not adequate for large scale air 
operations such as are conducted at McMurdo, but it is feasible
E                                                                   3

to build an adequate air facility there as a way point for           
continuing flights into the Antarctic continent.  The              
Argentine Antarctic authorities are understood to be exploring     
ways to upgrade the present runway facilities.  The U.S. Siple     
Station and the station at Halley Bay are only 900 miles (3½ hours  
flight time) from Seymour Island.                                    

From these two intercontinental terminals all major stations        
in Antarctica could receive air service through the inauguration   
of the airbus system.  The system would require:                     
(a) the establishment of a number of major runways on the continent 
and periodic scheduling of services to them and                     
(b)  the initiation of an inter-station "feeder line" service between 
the major terminals and all other stations, as well as field locations.

The several intracontinental terminals would serve as points        
from which other aircraft, e.g. small twin-engine planes, could      
economically operate to provide air service to all parts of Antarctica.
The minimum number of large terminals supporting the "feeder" service 
to other stations as conceived for the operation of the C-130, are:  

Seymour Island (Argentina)                                          
Halley Bay (United Kingdom)                                         
Molodezhnaya (USSR)                                                 
McMurdo (USA).                                                      

Prepared skiways are critical to the economical utilisation of      
ski aircraft under or near gross-weight operations.  Wheel runways  
are desirable wherever they can be developed, since they allow even 
greater payloads.  The four stations listed above are at locations  
suitable for the construction of runways or skiways necessary for the
operation of large heavy aircraft; some already have developed      
facilities.                                                          

"Feeder" service to areas of scientific interest could be handled    
by helicopter and/or small ski-equipped aircraft such as the        
DeHavilland Otter.  The flight capabilities of all nations working  
in Antarctica are such that this "feeder" service, operating among  
the several central terminals and the other Antarctic stations and 
field locations, could be provided without much re-arrangement of the
existing capability.  For example, scientists and logistic personnel 
delivered to Seymour Island (by Argentina, U.K., Chile, or U.S.A.)   
could be moved subsequently to virtually any location on the Antarctic
Peninsula by smaller aircraft or helicopter.  Or, scientists
4                                                             E

delivered to Molodeznaya by way of McMurdo (New Zealand or U.S.A.)
could be ferried to Syowa and Mawson with little difficulty, using
the air flight services now possessed by the USSR and Australia.

Weather data gathering and processing, together with an
improved international communications facility, would be required
to operate the air services and to provide for the safety of
planes and passengers.  Further, more common fuel and fueling
systems would be required, as well as co-ordinated communication
and aviation procedures.

Advantages to Science

The advantages of the airbus system to the Antarctic sciences
are numerous.  First and foremost, the airbus system would facili-
tate research by placing the scientists and technical experts in
the field on schedules that permit best use of their time.  All
study programmes that depend on access during the austral summer
period--geology, glaciology, biology--would benefit.  For some
portions of the Antarctic continent, a year-round access may be
feasible, aiding in the conduct of special studies in the atmos-
pheric sciences at locations such as Siple and Dumont d'Urville.
Equally important is the prospect of placing scientists in the
field to conduct studies in the pack ice zone around Antarctica,
a region to which they could deploy by aircraft, surface effect
vehicles, or other transport means.  Remote sensing studies,
which require both aircraft and trained observers, would be
facilitated by the development of the continent-wide network of
aviation support facilities.  The airbus system would facilitate
international co-operation in scientific research and data exchange
by virtue of the fact that scientists would come in contact with
their international colleagues at other stations through this
expanded logistic support system for international research.

The partial sharing of these resources for the flight support of 
all scientists in Antarctica would not create an undue burden on the 
resources of any nation.  Nor would the provision of the required 
fueling and aircraft servicing capabilities be a major burden if these 
capabilities were developed over a period of several Antarctic seasons 
with each nation concentrating on the further development of its 
present capability.  The key to the system is the collection or 
pooled value of the national contributions.

Once the facilities are established, the overall transportation 
system can be initiated.  For example, on a somewhat idealised 
schedule, a C-130 could operate as shown in Table 1.  It should be 
obvious that scientists delivered to any location, or picked up for 
further transport, could be placed in field locations by other air-
craft and/or returned to central terminals for further trunsportation 
northward.

Implementation

Implementation of the airbus system would be facilitated by an 
international discussion of the subject, through an appropriate forum 
such as the SCAR Working Group on Logistics. Such a discussion could
6                                         E

provide for a plan for the inventorying of existing aviation
resources and ground support facilities.  Specific arrangements
for field schedules could be pursued either on the basis of a
general discussion of the plan, or through bi-national and/or
multinational discussions to review the aviation resources of a
specific geographic region in Antarctica.  In both instances
the review would include an exchange of information on:  surveys
for and preparations of suitable skiways;  radio aids, homers,
and air-ground communications including high frequency/single
side band channels;  weather data;  fuel storage and delivery;
berthing and food for the aviation crew and passengers;  and the
utilisation of large and light aircraft.
