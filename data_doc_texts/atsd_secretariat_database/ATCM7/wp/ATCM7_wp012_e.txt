CLASSIFICATION OF CONSULTATIVE MEETING DOCUMENTS
(Draft Recommendation by United Kingdom)

The United Kingdom submits the following self-explanatory
draft Recommendation for consideration at the Seventh Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting:

The Representatives,

Recognising the interest of students of international affairs in
the operation of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that most of the numbered official documents of the
Antarctic Conference held at Washington in 1959 are
classified as "Conference Confidential"; that the
documents of the First Consultative Meeting held at
Canberra in 1961 are classified either as "Meeting
Confidential" or "Meeting Unclassified"; that the
documents of the Second Consultative Meeting held at
Buenos Aires in 1962 bear no classification marks;  that
most of the documents of the Third Consultative Meeting
held at Brussels in 1964 are classified as "Confidential";
and that none of the documents of subsequent Consultative
Meetings bear classification marks;

Considering that the rules regarding release for public access
of documents classified as confidential differ among the
twelve Consultative Parties;

Recalling that one of the major aims of the Antarctic Treaty is
to promote the availability of information concerning the
Treaty Area;
E.                                                             2.

Recommend to their Governments -

1. that all official documents of the Antarctic Conference held at Washington in 1959 and of the Consultative Meetings already held which were classified as confidential should be regarded as unclassified and available for public access, and

2. that all official documents of any subsequent Consultative Meeting should be unclassified and available for public access unless the Meeting expressly decides otherwise in respect of particular documents.
