CONSERVATION OF FAUNA AND FLORA

(Note by United Kingdom)

United Kingdom Action Taken to Implement Antarctic Treaty
Recommendations Relating to Conservation of Fauna and Flora

Following the adoption of the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora at the Third Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting Her Majesty's Government were advised
that legislation would be necessary to make illegal in United
Kingdom law those activities prohibited by the Agreed Measures.
The Antarctic Treaty Bill was introduced into the House of Commons
on 15 June 1966 and received the Royal Assent on 27 July 1967,
having passed through all its Parliamentary stages without amend-
ment. The Antarctic Treaty Act 1967* was brought into effect
for British citizens wherever they might be in the Antarctic
Treaty Area on 1 July 1968 by the Antarctic Treaty (Appointed
Day) Order 1968*.

Recommendations IV-1 to IV-11 and IV-13 to IV-15 were brought
into effect for British citizens by The Antarctic Treaty (Specially
Protected Areas) Order 1968*. Recommendations IV-16 and IV-17
were brought into effect for British citizens by The Antarctic
Treaty (Specially Protected Species Order) Order 1968*.

Recommendation V-5 was brought into effect for British citizens
by the Antarctic Treaty (Specially Protected Area) Order 1969*.

Recommendation VI-10 was brought into effect for British
citizens by The Antarctic Treaty (Specially Protected Area) Order
1971*

Legislative action to give effect to Recommendation IV-12 has
not been taken because of the revised description of the Specially
Protected Area set out in Recommendation V-5.
E                                         2.

Legislative action to give effect to Recommendation VI-8 
has not yet been taken.

Following legislation, Her Majesty's Government have approved 
Recommendations III-VIII, IV-1 to IV-11, IV-13 to IV-17, V-5 and 
VI-10. Recommendations IV-18 to IV-20, V-6 and VI-9 which are 
dependent on the Agreed Measures but which did not require legisla-
tive action have also been approved.

At the same time as considering and undertaking legislative 
action to give effect to the Agreed Measures steps have been taken 
to ensure that British citizens visiting the Antarctic as members 
of the British Antarctic Survey, or aboard HMS Endurance, are aware 
of the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty Act.  A copy 
of the current instructions contained in the British Antarctic 
Survey Base Commanders Manual is attached (in English only).

* Copies of these documents will be available for 
distribution in limited quantities at the meeting.
