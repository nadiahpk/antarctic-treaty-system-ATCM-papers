EFFECTS ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AND ON SCIENTIFIC
PROGRAMMES OF INCREASING EASE OF ACCESS
(Note by France)

Non-Government Expedition in the Antarctic

Captain Cousteau has informed the French Government that he
will carry out an oceanographic programme on board the "Calypso"
in the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula from October 1972 to
March 1973.

Aims of the Expedition

1.   Study the "In situ" behaviour of warm blooded sea animals -
     Cetaceans and seals of all species and birds, particularly
     penguins.

2.   Participation in the general research into progress on the
     productivity of the sea (primary cycle) and the preservation
     of the marine environment.

"Calypso" - Intended Programme

End of October 1972

Arrival of "Calypso" at Buenos Aires (from Monaco)

November

     Research on the coasts of the Argentine Republic between
     Buenos Aires and Ushaiag particularly in the Valdes
     Peninsula (right whales), Gulf San Jorge, Bahia Grande
     and Tierra del Fuego areas.

December

     Cross Drake Passage at the first opportunity to work in
     the South Shetlands, the Orkneys and the northeast tip of
     the Antarctic Peninsula.
2.                                                 E.

January-February 1973

Work to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula up to the south 
of Ross Island and to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, at 
least as far as Peterman Island and if possible to the south 
of Adelaide Island.

Return to Tierra del Fuego before the weather and ice 
conditions become bad for "Calypso".

March 1973

Work in the Chilean channels and around the islands from Punta 
Arenas to Valparaiso.

Means of Implementation

1.  "Calypso" has a well-trained crew, and a well-trained team of 
divers and underwater cameramen equipped with up-to-date 
diving and film shooting equipment.

2.  A bow capsule allows underwater shooting of films while the 
ship is underway.

3.  A two-seater "diving saucer" that can go 350 metres deep, 
carrying pilot, observer and cameras.

4.  A light 3 seater HUGHES 300-C helicopter for pilot and two 
observers with a four hour flight range.

5.  A two or three seater RAVEN INDUSTRIES hot air balloon.

6.  A weather satellite receiver (A.P.T.) (arrangement with 
N.O.A.A.).

7.  In collaboration with N.A.S.A. (Dr John Arvesen, NASA/AMES 
Laboratory) and with the assistance of an Argentinian plane, 
a "surface truth instrumentation" unit for measurements on 
chlorophyll, fat film, turbidity, and temperature in order 
to permit the intercalibration of the same measurements done 
by satellites.
