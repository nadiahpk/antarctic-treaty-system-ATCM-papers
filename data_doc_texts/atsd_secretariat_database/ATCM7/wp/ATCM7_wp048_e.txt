ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF
MINERAL EXPLOITATION

(Draft Recommendation submitted by Norway)

The Representatives,

Recognising that activities directed toward potential commercial
exploitation of mineral resources in the Antarctic Treaty Area will
raise problems with regard to the effects of such activities upon
the Antarctic environment;

Considering that such activities may affect the future develop-
ment of international scientific co-operation as organised under
the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that there is a need for further study and deliberation
between the Parties to the Treaty with a view to reaching an agreement
with regard to such activities;

Recommend to their Governments that they

(1) make problems arising from activities directed toward
economic exploitation of mineral resources in the Antarctic
Treaty Area a subject for continued deliberation in their
consultations under the Treaty;

(2) encourage further and systematic study of the potential
effects of such activities for the purpose of providing
essential information for consideration of the subject
at the next Consultative Meeting;

(3) as an interim measure, for the next years or until
common guidelines are agreed upon or permanent measures
for the regulation of such activities are adopted by
international agreement;

take appropriate steps
2

(a) to avoid activities directed toward commercial 
    exploitation of mineral resources in the Antarctic 
    Treaty Area
and

(b) to prevent any development that may prejudice the 
    continuing deliberations for this purpose.
