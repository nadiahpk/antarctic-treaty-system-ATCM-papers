HISTORIC MONUMENTS
(Proposal by United Kingdom)

It will be recalled that Recommendation VI-14 left a list
of historic monuments to be completed through diplomatic channels.
A draft list was set out in ANT/9/Rev. 1, dated 29 October 1970,
but could not be completed owing to difficulty in agreeing the
description of one monument.

It is suggested that this difficulty can be overcome by
drafting the heading of the list to read as follows:

"List of Historic Monuments as identified and described
by the proposing government or governments".

It is further suggested that the descriptions of the 40 items
listed in ANT/9/Rev. 1 be adopted.
