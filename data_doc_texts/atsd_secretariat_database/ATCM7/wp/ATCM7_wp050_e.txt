ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL
EXPLORATION
(Draft Recommendation submitted by Norway and
The United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Recalling the principles established in the Antarctic Treaty,
that is to say, inter alia:

(1)  It is in the interest of all mankind that the Antarctic Treaty
Area shall continue forever to be used exclusively for
peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object
of international discord;

(2)  the provision for freedom of scientific investigation in
the Antarctic Treaty Area and that co-operation toward
that end contained in Article II;

(3)  the provision for the exchange and free availability of
scientific observations and results from the Antarctic
Treaty Area contained in Article III;

(4)  the provisions contained in Article IV;

(5)  the provisions contained in Article VI;

(6)  the provisions for inspection within the Antarctic
Treaty Area contained in Article VII;

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty places a special
responsibility upon the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate
efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to
the end that no one engages in any activity in the Antarctic
Treaty Area contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty;

Considering that mineral exploration and resultant exploitation
may have harmful effects on the environment and that the Contracting
Parties should assume responsibility for the protection of the
2                                                         E

environment and the wise use of the Treaty Area;

Noting that there is a need for further study and deliberation 
between the Parties to the Treaty with a view to reaching agreement 
with regard to such activities;

Recalling that under the "Agreed Measures for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Fauna and Flora" the Antarctic Treaty Area is considered 
as a Special Conservation Area;

Conscious of the special situation in the Antarctic;

Recommend to their Governments that

(1) they encourage the publication and interchange of information,
     as well as co-operation, amongst the Consultative Parties 
     with a view to furthering studies of Antarctic geology;

(2) they study the subject in all its aspects with a view 
     to its inclusion on the Agenda of the Eighth Consultative 
     Meeting;

(3) as an interim measure until the next Consultative Meeting,
     they take appropriate steps to prevent any development 
     harmful to continued consultations on this subject or 
     prejudicial to their outcome.
