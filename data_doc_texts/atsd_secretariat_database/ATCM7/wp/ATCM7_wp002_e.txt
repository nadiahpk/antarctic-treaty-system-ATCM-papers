ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL
EXPLORATION

(Note by France)

Giyen the difficulty in dissociating industrial
prospecting from scientific prospecting, the French
Government considers that the problem regarding pros-
pecting is solved by the undertakings it gave by signing
the Treaty of Washington and insofar as the following
four conditions included in the treaty are respected:
-   prospecting must be of a peaceful nature (article 1)
-   there will be no nuclear explosions (article 5)
-   research must not affect the fauna and flora
-   the results of the work will be communicated to
the contracting parties.

Regarding the effects of the exploration of resources
the French Government makes the following remarks:
-   A very large part of the Antarctic Continent is
covered with a thick layer of ice and is therefore
practically impenetrable to present prospecting
techniques. As to the ice-free areas, although
the eventuality of a discovery and of exploitation
cannot be excluded, these are not likely to take
place in the near future because of the serious
obstacle of the permafrost.  Thus, in spite of a
theoretically great mineral potential, the mining
of the Antarctic does not seem possible for several
decades.
-   One of the main preoccupations of the countries
that are signatories to the treaty is the protection
of the ecology of the Antarctic Continent and the
proceedings of the recent Stockholm conference suggest
that any measure to protect the environment and
combat pollution should be favourably received.

-   Similarly, a decision which would preserve the potential resources of the Antarctic Continent 
    for future generations should be agreed to by 
    all participants.

-   The search for a solution to problems of mining 
    the Antarctic must be subordinated to the solution 
    of the problem of how to avoid rivalries the 
    consequences of which would inevitably be borne 
    by the powers in possession of Antarctic 
    territory.

    For these reasons, the French Government proposes 
the inclusion in the provision agenda of the 7th 
Consultative Meeting of a recommendation aimed at 
forbidding the exploitation of the mineral resources 
of the Antarctic Continent for a limited period, of 
the order of ten to fifteen years.
