SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
(Draft Recommendation submitted by New Zealand, South Africa
and the United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Having considered the report produced by the Twelfth
Meeting of SCAR on the "Purposes and Designation of Special
Areas";

Recognising that:

(1) certain small localities, not suitable for
designation as Specially Protected Areas, none-
theless are of special geological, botanical,
zoological or other scientific interest;

(2) scientific experiments may be jeopardised by
accidental or wilful interference;

Considering that such sites should be accorded a measure
of protection, by means of individual management plans regula-
ting access and use for specified period, in order to permit
scientific investigations to be carried out without such
interference;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees,
to consider this matter further and make recommenda-
tions for the designation of Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (together with a management
plan for each site);

2. They study the subject further with a view to its
inclusion on the Agenda of the Eighth Consultative
Meeting.
