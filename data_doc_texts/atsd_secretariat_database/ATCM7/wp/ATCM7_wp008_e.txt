PURPOSES AND DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL AREAS
(Note by United Kingdom)

The United Kingdom suggests that under this item it wnuld
be useful to discuss three broad objectives:

(1) A revision of the existing "Specially Protected Areas"
many of which are too big to make exclusion of visitors
practical. We need to re-define these "Specially
Protected Areas" and their purposes - to exclude all
human interference from a few small specified areas
unless there is a compelling scientific reason for
entering these areas.

(2) We should consider designating "Special Study Areas",
where casual visitors (tourists) can be excluded, and
where scientists can be confident that long or short-
term experiments will not be disturbed. These are the
same as the "Areas of Special Scientific Interest" or
"Scientifically Managed Areas" discussed in the United
States proposal in document PP 3/14.

(3) There are possibilities for designating "Special Tourist
Areas" where non-government expeditions could be encouraged
to concentrate their activities thus narrowing the field
of interference with natural ecological systems which are
still so imperfectly understood.

It is proposed that general principles be discussed with
a view to study of appropriate "Areas" to be designated at the
Eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
