ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS

(Draft statement for inclusion in the Final Report; prepared
by the Telecommunications Working Group for consideration by
Plenary)

Representatives noted with appreciation the contribution to
Antarctic radio propagation and ionospheric studies made at the
SCAR Symposium on "Scientific and Technical Problems Affecting
Antarctic Telecommunications" held in Sandefjord, Norway, in
May 1972 and welcomed the Interim Report of the SCAR Group of
Specialists (Revised 25 August 1972).

In taking note of SCAR's opinion that a manual of technical
guidance for efficient telecommunications would be advantageous
to radio operators at Antarctic stations, Representatives agreed
that each government would draw this suggestion to the attention
of their offices administering Antarctic programmes.  If their
offices considered that such a manual would be helpful they should
be urged to co-operate to reach agreement on those parts of the
text which would benefit from drawing together national experience
in this field.  For the guidance of their offices, Representatives
considered that the manual might adopt a standardised loose-leaf
format in order to facilitate the incorporation of amendments and
might contain, inter alia:

(1) texts on the factors affecting radio propagation
in the Antarctic, and on the general operating
procedures which experience has shown to be useful
in adverse conditions;

(2) a brief statement about the Antarctic telecommuni-
cations system of each Consultative Party and its
normal operating procedures;
2.


(3) information on telecommunications equipment and
schedules based on that exchanged in accordance with
Recommendation VI-2.

In connection with the exchange of information on telecommuni-
cations in accordance with Recommendation VI-2, it was noted that
the present timing of the exchange, in accordance with
Recommendation IV-23 (Date of exchange of information), made it
difficult to ensure that this information reached Antarctic radio
operators in time to be of use. Representatives expressed the view
that it should prove operationally beneficial if this information
were to be exchanged by 30 June, at the same time as the reporting
of modifications of planned activities under Recommendation II-VI.
In view, however, of the pending review of all exchanges of
information under the Antarctic Treaty it was felt to be inappro-
priate to make a Recommendation to Governments at this time.  It
was agreed instead that, until such time as the overall review has
been completed, Governments should be urged to exchange notifications
of planned alterations to their telecommunications equipment and
procedures at the same time as they exchange information under
Recommendation II-VI.
