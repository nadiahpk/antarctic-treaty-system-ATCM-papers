SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

(Revised draft Recommendation submitted by
New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom
and the United States)

The Representatives,

Recognising that:

(1) Scientific investigations may be jeopardised by accidental
or wilful interference;

(2) sites where such investigations are proceeding may require
a measure of protection;

(3) because of the continuing scientific investigations in them,
certain localities of botanical or zoological interest are
not suitable for designation as Specially Protected Areas
under the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Fauna and Flora;

(4) sites of non-biological interest cannot be designated as
Specially Protected Areas;

Considering that the application to such sites of individual
management plans regulating access and use for a specified
period, would enable investigations at these sites to
be carried out without interference;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees,
to consider this matter further and make suggestions
for the designation of Sites of Special Scientific
Interest (together with a proposed management plan for
each site);

2. They study the subject further with a view to its
inclusion on the Agenda of the Eighth Consultative
Meeting.
