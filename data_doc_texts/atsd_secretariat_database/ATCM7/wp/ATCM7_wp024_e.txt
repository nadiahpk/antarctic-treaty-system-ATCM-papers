ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL
EXPLORATION

(Draft Recommendation by South Africa)

THE REPRESENTATIVES

Recognising
that mineral exploration and resultant exploitation in
Antarctica are likely to raise problems of an
environmental and juridical character;

Acknowledging
that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsibility
upon the Contracting Parties to that Treaty to exert
appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the
United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any
activity in Antarctica contrary to the principles or
purposes of that Treaty;

Convinced
that the principles enshrined in the Antarctic Treaty,
which have governed man's activities in that region in
the past, should continue to do so in the future;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS

1. that they accept the principle that all Contracting
Parties to the Treaty will not issue any prospecting
licences for the Treaty Area without prior consultation
with the other Parties to the Treaty.
2. that they agree to extend the provisions of Article
III (1) of the Treaty, concerning the free exchange
of scientific information acquired in Antarctica, to cover
2.             E.

also any scientific or other information acquired in the Treaty Area by any prospecting group sponsored by non-
governmental enterprises.

3. that they accept and support the offer of the Fridtjof Nansen Foundation to convene in Oslo in 1973 a
non-governmental conference of experts to identify and discuss the problems connected with the exploration and 
exploitation of the natural resources of Antarctica, and to prepare a report on their deliberations for consideration 
at the Eighth Consultative Meeting.
