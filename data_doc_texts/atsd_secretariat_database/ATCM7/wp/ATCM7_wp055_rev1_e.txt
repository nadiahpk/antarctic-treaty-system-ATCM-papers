CO-OPERATION IN TRANSPORT
(Draft Recommendation)

The Representatives,

Recognising that the relative inaccessability of many regions
of the Antarctic Treaty Area creates special transport problems;

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international
co-operation in scientific investigation in Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They accept the principle of using, where appropriate,
common transport facilities by sea and by air for
scientific and other personnel proceeding with their
equipment to and from Antarctic stations;

2. They encourage bilateral or multilateral arrangements
between Contracting Parties to establish when such
sharing of transport facilities would be mutually
convenient and practicable;

3. The cost of any shared facilities be met by arrangement
between the Contracting Parties concerned, either by
direct payment, by reciprocation in kind, or by other
mutually agreed means.
