EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXPEDITIONS TO
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Noting the increase in the number of tourists and also in the
number of visitors who are not sponsored by the Consultative
Parties to the Antarctic Treaty Area;

Considering that both governments and such visitors would
benefit from having available to them an agreed statement:

(a) of accepted practices in the Treaty Area including,
inter alia, the need for self sufficiency and prior
notification of intended arrival at a station, which
such visitors would be expected to follow (to which
could be appended the particular conditions imposed
by each government for a visit to any one of its
stations); and

(b) of the relevant provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and
of the Recommendations made under it;

Recalling Recommendations VI-7 and VI-11 concerning the
possible harmful effects of such visitors on scientific programmes
and on the Antarctic environment;

Convinced of the need to avoid unnecessary interference with
natural ecological systems which are not sufficiently understood
and continue to be the subject of research;

Conscious that the Treaty Area contains many unique features
of historical, scenic and general scientific interest;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They keep under review the effects of tourists and other
visitors who are not sponsored by the Consultative
Parties to the Treaty Area in the light of existing
Recommendations;
2.

2. They consider drawing up at the Eighth Consultative Meeting 
a statement of those accepted practices and relevant
provisions about which all visitors to the Treaty Area
should be aware;

3. They consult each other well in advance about the possi-
bility of designating at the Eighth Consultative Meeting an
adequate number of areas of interest to which tourists could
be encouraged to go, and about the criteria to be used to
determine such areas;

4. They use their best endeavours to ensure that the provisions
of the Treaty and subsequent Recommendations relating to the
Conservation of Fauna and Flora are applied in practice to
all members of expeditions which are not sponsored by the
Consultative Parties, including tourists.
