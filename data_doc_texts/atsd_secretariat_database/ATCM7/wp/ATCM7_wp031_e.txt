EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION
(Paper submitted by U.S.A)

Explanation: The following suggested format is arranged according to the chronological order of Recommendations on infor-
mation exchange thus far agreed upon. The first ten major headings
follow the ten paragraphs of Recommendation I-6. Information
Reports issued by most countries already follow this format to
varying degrees. The method of stating the relevant requirement
at the head of each section of the report is also used by a number
of countries. Use of this standard format would not necessarily
preclude the inclusion of additional or more detailed information
that some countries provide in their existing reports. If a
category is not applicable to a particular country, that should
be stated.
