SCAR Circular 499

To:  National Committees

Dear Sir

In the attachment to SCAR Circular 492, summarising Antarctic Treaty related 
items from XVIII SCAR, item 5 includes a note about the concern expressed by 
XVIII SCAR that the three proposals for SSSIs incorporating marine areas had 
not yet been recognised and the hope of XVIII SCAR that these sites would be 
formally designated by the Thirteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
in 1985.

You may wish to remind your Government of this by conveying to them again 
the proposals as previously submitted.  For ease of reference I am enclosing 
copies of the three proposals in question.

Yours faithfully

G E Hemmen
Executive Secretary
Marine Site of Special Scientific Interest
Chile Bay, Greenwich Island

Management Plan

(i)    Description of Site

The Site comprises two small areas of benthic habitat located as follows :

Benthic Habitat A : Between 50 and 100 m. depths and the following coordinates

L 62° 28,9' S    G 59° 41' 12" W
L 62° 29,3' S    G 59° 41' 43" W

Benthic Habitat B : Between 100 and 200 m. depths and the following coordinates :

L 62° 28,3' S    G 59° 40' 15" W
L 62° 28,7' S    G 59° 40' 47" W

(ii)   Reason for Designation

In Chile Bay there has been continued quantitative and qualitative research. Accumu-
lated data provides a baseline for long-term investigations. These areas are of exceptional
scientific interest and therefore require protection from possible harmful interference.

(iii)  Outline of Research

A long-term research programme started in summer 1968/69, in connection with the
benthic fauna reestablishment study of Port Foster, Deception Island, following volcanic
eruption of December 1967. Chile Bay has been designated as control study area. These
studies are performed yearly during the summer. The community criterion to observe biota
changes will be implemented with other acceptable criteria in order to comply with requi-
sites of a long-term biological monitoring programme.

(iv)  Date of expiry of designation

December 1991

(v)   Access points

Although access points as such are not applicable, free passage of ships through these
areas is not in any way prejudiced.

(vi)  Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Not applicable

(vii) Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause harmful interference.

Scientific research in the water above the areas other than that which would grossly
disturb the benthic habitat.

(viii) Scientific sampling

Samples from the benthic habitats should only be taken for compelling scientific
purposes.

(ix)  Other restraints

The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided. Anchoring
should be avoided other than in compelling circumstances.

Managment Plan

(i)     Description of Site

The Site comprises two small areas of benthic habitat located as fallows :
Benthic Habitat A : Between 50 and 150m. depths and the following coordinates:

      L 62°55;5 S         G 60° 38' 00"W
      L 62°56;2 S         G 60° 37' 00"W

Benthic Habitat B : Between 100 and 150m depths and following coordinates :

      L 62°57;2 S         G 60°37'20"W
      L 62°57;9 S         G 60°36'20"W

(ii)    Reason for designation

These two areas are subject to long term research programmes and the purpose in de-
signating them is, as far as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference which could
jeopardise these scientific investigations.

(iii)   Outline of rescarch

Following the volcanic eruptions of December 1967 in Deception Island, a long-term
programme was iniciated in Port Foster to study. the mechanisms and paths of the reestablish-
ment of the benthic biological communities. It is thus important that the areas in Port Fostef
should not be disturbed, as far as practicable. by extraneous influences other than those asso-
ciated wich the necessary scientific sampling procedures.

(iv)   Date of expiry of designation

December 1991

(v)    Access points

Although access points as such are not applicable, free passage of ships through these
areas is not in any way prejudiced.

(vi)   Pedestrian and vehicular routes

ing should be avoided other than in compelling circumstances.

Site of Special Scientific Interest
South Bay, Doumer Island
Palmer Archipelago

Management Plan

(i)     Description of Site

The site consists of a small area of coastal and subtidal benthos down to 45m
depth as follows: Latitude 64° 51' 42" S to the North, between Longitudes 63° 34' 00" W
and 63° 35' 20" W; and to the South by a diagonal line that starts at a point 100 metres
north of the Refuge on the southern shore of South Bay to 64° 51' 58" S, 63° 34' 00" W.
Boundaries are shown on the attached map.

(ii)    Reason for designation

This site is subject of a long-term research programme on ecology and the purpose
of designating it is, as far as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference wich
can jeopardise these scientific investigations.

(iii)   Outline of Research

The study of the relationships among marine organisms started by scuba diving
in this area in 1972. Since 1981 advanced type experiments to understand community
structure and functioning are under way, and will continue in the future.  These require
the avoidance, as much as possible of artificial interference.

(iv)    Date of Expiry of Designation

December 1991

(v)     Access points

Access points as such are not applicable.  Area is not affected by passage of boats.

(vi)    Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Restricted

(vii)   Other kinds of scientific investigations wich would not cause harmful interference.

Any scientific research that requires collection of organisms should be avoided.
Observations by scuba diving would not cause significant interference.

(viii)  Scientific sampling

Collection of samples only for compelling scientific purposes

(ix)    Other restraints

The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided.  Ancho-
ring should be avoided unless under compelling circumstances.
