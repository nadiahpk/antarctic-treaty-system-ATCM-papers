1.  Type of Action:  Expansion of a Program

2.  Brief Description of Proposed Action:

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic and applied scientific research, and to initiate and support programs to strengthen scientific research potential.  The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was established by the National Science Board in March, 1982.  Through this program, the NSF is supporting a new scientific ocean drilling program as a successor to the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP).  The NSF views the ODP as a major long-term scientific program likely to continue for a decade or more.

Through the ODP, scientists and governments from many countries have joined together to explore the structure and history of the earth beneath the ocean basins.  The central purpose of the ODP is to provide core samples from the ocean floors and the facilities to study those samples.  Data generated will lead to a better understanding of seafloor spreading, plate tectonics, the structure of the earth's interior, evolution of life in the oceans, climatic changes through time, and, in turn, to a fuller comprehension of the structure of our planet.  The United States, United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, Canada, and the European Science Foundation Consortium (composed of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) are cooperating to organize and undertake the project.

Drilling operations are carried out on board the drillship JOIDES RESOLUTION (SEDC0/BP 471).  Scientific operations and logistics are developed through Texas A&M Research Foundation.  Program management is provided by Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc. (JOI).  Program oversight and funding are provided by the NSF.  Scientific plans are developed through the international scientific consortium, Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES).  JOI and JOIDES were key components of the DSDP management and planning structure, also.

3. Purpose of the DEIS:

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as amended (NEPA, PL 
91-190) requires Federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of 
all proposed actions and their alternatives, and, when appropriate and 
necessary, document this evaluation in an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS).  By complying with the NEPA process, Federal agencies ensure that 
environmentally responsible decisions are made, based upon analysis of 
the best available information and with full participation of the public.

The ODP differs from most activities for which EISs are prepared.  
The ODP is primarily a scientific endeavor of significant benefit.  It 
is the continuation of scientific activity that has been ongoing for two 
decades, and it is the product of extensive planning and preparation.

The NSF prepared an EIS (NSF 1975) on the International Phase of Ocean 
Drilling (IPOD) of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP).  The 1975 EIS 
addresses scientific ocean drilling carried out globally in major and minor 
ocean basins.  Initial drilling operations of the ODP do not differ signi-
ficantly from those carried out during IPOD and addressed in the DSD/IPOD 
EIS (NSF 1975).

The decade-long program will expand efforts in scientific deep-ocean 
drilling and research.  The program is global in scope and builds on the 
successes of DSDP/IPOD.  Plans call for drilling in high latitudes, including 
antarctic seas, and drilling on continental margins in addition to carrying 
out the more typical drilling operations characteristic of the previous 
DSDP/IPOD.

The ODP differs from DSDP/IPOD in two important aspects.  First, the 
research vessel, JOIDES RESOLUTION (SEDCO/BP 471), is more modern and more 
capable than its predecessor, GLOMAR CHALLENGER, which was used for the 
DSDP/IPOD, but does not differ significantly from CHALLENGER in the type 
or amount of materials/wastes discharged under a riserless mode of drilling. 
Second, in the future the ODP will be able to use a marine riser and subsea 
well control system to safely drill riser holes deeper into sedimentary 
sequences on continental margins than was possible with CHALLENGER.  This 
will allow coring in areas of significant scientific interest that were 
bypassed by the DSDP/IPOD because of safety concerns.

The purpose of this EIS is to address the more complicated aspects 
of riser drilling and of drilling in high latitudes and antarctic seas 
not previously addressed in the DSDP/IPOD EIS (NSF 1975).  Drilling modes 
that were adequately analyzed in the DSDP/IPOD EIS (NSF 1975) are reviewed 
in this EIS.  Additionally, aspects of drilling in deep-ocean trenches, 
on active spreading centers, and in or near environmentally-sensitive regions 
are considered.  Potential environmental impacts are identified and discussed. 
Drilling in the Weddell Sea is currently scheduled between December, 1986 
and February, 1987.  No riser drilling on continental margins is planned 
for the immediate future.

4. Rationale in Selecting Sites for Discussion:

This document has been developed as a programmatic EIS, addressing 
the scope of the ODP while taking into account the technical capabilities 
of the drillship, the competence of the vessel operator, as well as the 
worldwide locations in which the program will be carried out.  To facilitate 
consideration of potential impacts associated with drilling sites, this 
EIS evaluation focuses on four representative drilling sites:  Georges 
Bank, East Pacific Rise, Mid-American Trench, and the Weddell Sea.  The 
sites encompass the range of scientific goals, and geographic and ecologic 
conditions expected over the course of the ODP to ensure coverage of all 
foreseeable impacts.

Sites were chosen by considering the major scientific goals.  Then 
three sets of criteria were evaluated to determine which sites would cover 
the range of subjects to be addressed in the EIS:

-   Environmental factors
-   Risk elements
-   Data availabililty.

The four sites selected are shown in Figure A.  The four sites and 
the areas of major discussion presented under each site are listed in Table 
A.

All four sites are addressed within the same subject category in Chapter 
3 (Affected Environment) and Chapter 4 (Environmental Consequences).  This 
approach results in a complete discussion of all potential impacts by the 
end of the four site assessments.

5. Summary of Environmental Impacts and Adverse Environmental Effects:

The continuation of scientific ocean drilling throughout the global 
oceans will have negligible impacts on major oceanic ecosystems.  Environmental 
effects of normal drilling operations will be temporary and will be detectable 
only in the immediate vicinity of the drillship (surface waters) or drill 
hole (seafloor).  Significant effects are identified only for the localized 
impacts of drill cuttings on the benthic community (smothering) in the 
immediate vicinity of the drill hole.  Only about 100 m^(2) (1,076 ft^(2)) of 
seafloor around the drill hole are expected to be impacted, however, and 
recruitment/repopulation in the area of the drill hole is expected to take 
place.

The expansion of scientific ocean drilling into high latitudes (i.e., 
antarctic seas) and onto continental margins will have only localized, 
temporary impacts.  Riserless drilling in antarctic waters will release 
surface seawater (used as the drilling fluid), drilling muds, and cuttings 
at the seafloor.  Riser drilling on continental shelves will release drilling 
muds and cuttings at the sea surface which may cause minor accumulation 
of some trace metals by organisms.  Negligible effects are expected on 
the ecosystem and on humans eating marine organisms.

Of the many potential impacts (outside the normal range of operations) 
investigated, the following would have the greatest significance:

  Blowout of gas or brine could occur when.drilling into sedi-
mentary deposits, though the probability of this occurrence 
is,very small

  Severe short-term impacts from sound sources used during 
seismic surveying could affect sonar/hearing of marine mammals, 
or even lead to mortality, if individuals were in immediate 
proximity to the drillship

  Blowout and subsequent uncontrolled release of oil in an 
environmentally-sensitive region (worst-case analysis, P<0.01) 
might cause the loss of the drillship and all personnel.

A summary of the relative magnitude, persistence, and probability of impacts 
resulting from various ODP operations is listed in Table B.

6. Summary of Major Alternatives Considered and Proposed Mitigating Measures:

Alternatives to the proposed expansion of drilling activities by the 
Ocean Drilling Program are to: 1) delay or exclude implementation of drilling 
plans pertaining to selected sites; 2) exclude drilling in sensitive areas; 
and 3) delay or exclude implementation of riser drilling.

Mitigating measures are: 1) exclusion of drilling "on structure"; 
2) observance of applicable U.S. Coast Guard laws/regulations; 3) observance 
of IMCO requirements for the Control of Pollution from Drilling Vessels; 
4) adherence to Federal Water Pollution Control Act and Marine Protection, 
Research, and Sanctuaries Act; 5) compliance with U.S. Geological Survey 
rules governing drilling activities; 6) compliance with Antarctic Treaty 
guidelines and Antarctic Conservation Act; 7) site review by JOIDES Pollution 
Prevention and Safety Panel; 8) site review by Texas A&M Research Foundation 
Safety Panel; 9) site-specific well planning procedures; 10) on-site monitoring 
for hydrocarbons, H_(2)S, methane gas, etc.; 11) contingency planning; and 
12) ship's personnel training.

CHAPTER 1

PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

 
1
Section 1.1
INTRODUCTION

This chapter reviews the background of the proposed action, describes 
the goals and objectives of the program, and documents its inception.
A more complete description of the ODP is presented in Chapter 2.

THE PROPOSED ACTION

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is authorized by the National 
Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, to initiate and support basic 
and applied scientific research, and to initiate and support programs to 
strengthen scientific research potential. The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) 
was established by the National Science Board in March, 1982.  Through 
this program, the NSF is supporting a new scientific ocean drilling program 
as a successor to the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). This program is 
funded by the NSF and managed through a contract with the Joint Oceanographic 
Institutions, Inc. (JOI), which subcontracts scientific shipboard and shore-
based operations to Texas A & M Research Foundation at Texas A & M University 
(TAMU) and logging operations to Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory 
(L-DGO).  The NSF views the ODP as a major long-term scientific program 
likely to continue for a decade or more.

    Through the ODP, scientists and governments from many countries have 
joined together to explore the structure and history of the earth beneath 
the ocean basins. The central purpose of the ODP is to provide core samples 
from the ocean floors and the facilities to study those samples.  The United 
States, United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, Canada, 
and the European Science Foundation (composed of a consortium of Belgium, 
Denmark, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) 
are cooperating to organize and undertake the project.  An international 
scientific organization, the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep 
Earth Sampling (JOIDES), formally provides long-term scientific planning 
and goals for the program. Data generated will lead to a better understanding 
of seafloor spreading, continental drift, the structure of the earth's 
interior, evolution of life in the oceans, climatic changes through time, 
and, in turn, to a fuller comprehension of the structure of our planet 
and the dynamic processes which have shaped it.

    The ODP differs from the DSDP in two important aspects.  First, the 
research vessel, SEDCO/BP 471, informally renamed JOIDES RESOLUTION for 
the ODP, is superior to its predecessor.  It offers advantages (detailed 
in Section 2.2) over GLOMAR CHALLENGER, which was used for the DSDP.  Second, 
in the future the ODP will be able to use a marine riser and subsea well 
control system to safely drill holes deeper into sedimentary sequences 
on continental margins at some later date.  This will allow coring in areas 
of significant scientific interest that were bypassed by the DSDP because 
of safety concerns.

PURPOSE OF THE EIS

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as amended (NEPA, PL 91-190) requires Federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of all proposed actions and their alternatives, and, when appropriate and necessary, document this evaluation in an environmental impact statement (EIS).  By complying with the NEPA process, Federal agencies ensure that environmentally responsible decisions are made, based upon analysis of the best available information and with full participation of the public.

In its initial stage, the ODP will continue scientific drilling operations similar to those carried out on board GLOMAR CHALLENGER since 1968.  For such operations, the EIS prepared in 1975 for the International Phase of Ocean Drilling of the DSDP still applies. However, in view of the expanded activities under the ODP, the NSF has decided to prepare this programmatic EIS. It addresses the large number of potential sites and all possible types of drilling which could be undertaken over the expected life of the ODP. This EIS specifically addresses the environmental considerations and consequences of drilling in high latitudes, drilling with a riser and blowout prevention system, drilling on continental margins, and drilling in or near environmentally-sensitive regions.

Section 1.2
BACKGROUND ON SCIENTIFIC DEEP OCEAN DRILLING

The ODP continues an activity that began over 25 years ago with Project
Mohole, the first attempt to drill through the earth's crust to the mantle.
Since 1957, the NSF has supported scientific deep-sea drilling through
several projects. This section describes the history of these deep-sea
drilling activities, and thus the background of the present program.

PROJECT MOHOLE AND POST-MOHOLE STUDIES

Project Mohole was developed to test theories of earth science by
coring and measurement of the characteristics of sediments and rocks from
the earth's crust to the mantle. The name "Mohole" came from the Mohorovicic
Discontinuity (MOHO), the seismic boundary between the crust and mantle,
and the project's ultimate drilling target. The earth's crust is thinnest
in deep ocean basins below the seafloor. Consequently, plans were developed
to drill in water depths far exceeding the contemporary limits of offshore
operations, and the NSF agreed to fund the project.

The drilling vessel CUSS I (a trial platform to test theories and
practices) began drilling in 948 m (3,109 ft) of water in March, 1961.
Holes drilled by CUSS I during the program produced cores representing
the first deep, continuous sampling of sediments and rocks below the ocean
surface. Although drilling depths did not come close to the MOHO, the
project produced valuable data from the recovered cores. New engineering
system, were also developed and field tested. The full project did not
receive funding and the Mohole platform was not completed.

Following Mohole, the NSF discussed the need for an ocean sediment
coring program with oceanographers, geophysicists, and geologists. In
the spring of 1964, four major oceanographic institutions formed JOIDES,
a consortium that provided scientific advisory planning and guidance.
The original group consisted of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory,
Columbia University; the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science,
University of Miami; the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University
of California at San Diego; and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
The University of Washington joined the consortium in 1968. The NSF sponsored
a drilling program in the summer of 1965 on the Blake Plateau using the
dynamically positioned drilling vessel CALDRILL I. The success of this
work led to establishment of the DSDP.

DEEP SEA DRILLING PROJECT

The DSDP proposed to gather core samples and information from the
ocean floor. The project was launched in 1968 using the dynamically positioned
drillship GLOMAR CHALLENGER, which enabled scientists to drill at
ocean depths up to 7,000 m (22,960 ft) and with penetration of 1,700 m
(5,576 ft) beneath the seafloor. DSDP drilling operations made noteworthy
contributions to deep-sea drilling technology. Among the technical innovations

4
used first by the project and now by the offshore drilling industry are
computerized dynamic positioning, sonar borehole reentry techniques, improved
core bits and equipment, and improved coring techniques.  The program made
major contributions to better understanding of the chronology of tectonic
and environmental events and the evolution of ocean circulation and marine
life.  In particular, the DSDP provided some of the strongest evidence
supporting the model of plate tectonics.

The plate tectonics model was initially developed by Hess (1962) from
geophysical and geological observations in the oceans and from earthquake
seismology. Present-day models propose the generation of crust at oceanic
ridges, followed by lateral transport of the oceanic crust and sediments,
and ultimate addition of some of this material to existing continental
crust (Figure 1). A second aspect of the plate tectonics model implies
that 200 million years ago a supercontinent was fragmented by a process
termed rifting. With the continuous generation of new crust, the rifted
continental fragments moved apart by the process of seafloor spreading
(Dietz 1961) toward the present configuration of continents. This movement
apparently continues today (Figure 2). Movement of the continents has
changed ocean circulation, weather, and climate.  It is the record of these
changes, preserved in the sedimentary column beneath the seafloor, that
the DSDP recovered by coring.

INTERNATIONAL PHASE OF OCEAN DRILLING

The early phases of the DSDP completed a major reconnaissance over
most of the world's oceans, except the ice-covered oceans and the thick
sedimentary sequences on the continental shelves. The International Phase
of Ocean Drilling (IPOD) was initiated in 1975 as the scope of the program
changed to address specific problems on an international scale. The composition
of JOIDES changed with the addition of the following oceanographic insti-
tutions: Bundesanstalt fur Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe, Federal Republic
of Germany; Centre National pour l'Exploitation des Oceans, France (now
part of Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer);
Hawaii Institute of Geophysics, University of Hawaii; Natural Environment
Research Council, United Kingdom; School of Oceanography, Oregon State
University; Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island;
Department of Oceanography, Texas A & M University; Ocean Research Institute,
University of Tokyo, Japan; and U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.

DSDP/IPOD drilling activities came to an end when CHALLENGER was decom-
missioned in Mobile, Alabama on November 20, 1983 at the end of Leg 96.
Table 1 lists some of the technical achievements accomplished during the
DSDP. One thousand one hundred five holes were drilled and cored during
the DSDP (Figure 3). During the 15-year period of its operation, CHALLENGER
experienced 85 percent operational time, with an additional 11 percent
of the time occupied by portside logistics handling. With only 4 percent
of the time lost to weather and equipment downtime, the program was both
an operational and a scientific success.

OCEAN MARGIN DRILLING PROGRAM

It was recognized that the capabilities of CHALLENGER were not adequate to meet the remaining scientific goals of ocean drilling. A drilling platform to operate in greater water depths, remain on station for longer time periods, achieve deeper penetrations, and carry greater loads was required. Moreover, some scientific objectives required a vessel with an ice-strengthened hull and improved weather-handling capabilities for operations in otherwise inaccessible areas. A key conference (i.e., the FUSOD conference) was held in March, 1977 to discuss the direction of future scientific ocean drilling and to detail a program of future work.

In 1980-1981, the Ocean Margin Drilling Program (OMDP) was sponsored jointly by the NSF and a consortium of 10 major U.S. oil companies. This program called for an advanced state-of-the-art drillship to drill in thick sedimentary sequences on the ocean margins. As originally conceived, the OMDP would have converted the U.S. government-owned ship GLOMAR EXPLORER into a drill ship to carry and deploy a 4,000-m (13,120-ft) riser and subsea well control system. When the oil companies withdrew support in October, 1981, the NSF alone could not support such a program and the OMDP was terminated.

ADVANCED OCEAN DRILLING PROGRAM

The OMDP had created serious debate in the ocean science community because of its narrow focus on continental margin drilling. The proprietary interest of the oil companies had made international participation and support, which was central to the success of the DSDP/IPOD, difficult to obtain. The Advanced Ocean Drilling Program (AODP) represented an attempt to combine the broad-based scientific objectives of the DSDP with the technical capabilities of the OMDP.

Scientific plans for the AODP were formulated primarily at the Conference on Scientific Ocean Drilling (COSOD) in November, 1981. The AODP also centered around the use of EXPLORER, but with a two-phase conversion that would delay riser operation for several years. However, when the preliminary design for EXPLORER conversion was completed in November, 1982, it became apparent that costs would exceed budgetary limits. Fortunately, in 1982, the charter rates for commercial drillships dropped dramatically. The NSF therefore, moved to charter a modern commercial drillship that could meet program requirements at a lower cost than EXPLORER.

OCEAN DRILLING PROGRAM

To distinguish the revised project from the EXPLORER-based AODP, the name was shortened to the Ocean Drilling Program. In fact, the scientific objectives, management plans, and budget of the ODP were identical to those of the AODP; only the ship plan changed.

In February, 1984, JOI, the ODP management contractor, announced the charter of the modern, dynamically positioned drillship JOIDES RESOLUTION. With relatively minor conversions, the ship satisfied the program's technical requirements (e.g., larger laboratory space, greater sea-keeping ability, ice-strengthened hull, longer drill string, and riser capabilities) to 
10
meet scientific goals that were unachievable with CHALLENGER.  The ODP and its vessel are described in detail in Chapter 2.

The ODP will be a long-term program of fundamental research on the earth's crust beneath the ocean.  The scope is global, extending eventually into every ocean, and combines the reconnaissance capability of the DSDP with modern offshore technology and a 2,000-m (6,560-ft) riser.  The research agenda addresses some of the most important questions concerning the structure, processes, and evolution of the crust of the earth.

11
Section 1.3
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

ODP objectives proposed by the scientific community focus on the following
subject areas: tectonics of the ocean basins, the generation and destruction
of ocean crust, paleoclimatology, paleonotology, and paleoceanography.
In addition, investigations of thick sedimentary sequences in water depths
to 2,000 m (6,560 ft) are expected to reveal the history of the margins
themselves; the erosion of the adjacent continents; and the deposition,
thermal history, and chemistry of the sediments.  Four study categories
can be defined:

  •   Oceanic crust

  •   Active margins

  •   Passive margins

  •   Ocean paleoenvironment.

A brief explanation of each category is provided in this section.  More
detailed descriptions of the objectives than presented here can be found
in reports by the committee on Post-IPOD Science (1979), JOIDES (1981,
1982), and NSF (1983).

OCEAN CRUSTAL STUDIES

Studies of dredged rocks, investigations of ophiolite complexes on
the continents, analyses of marine geophysical data, results of theoretical
modeling, and data from deep-ocean crustal drilling by CHALLENGER provided
the elements of a working model of the formation of oceanic crust.  Research
on mid-ocean ridges and oceanic basins is needed to test the essential
elements of this model and to explain the relationships between its component
parts and new concepts of geological processes.

Advanced deep-ocean drilling capability is necessary to meet some
objectives of ocean crustal studies. One objective is to study the composition,
structure, and properties of the deep-ocean crust (Layer 3).  Hypotheses
concerning its origin are diverse.  If its origin, composition, and physical
properties can be determined accurately, use of seismic refraction data
for geological interpretation will be enhanced considerably.  Reaching
Layer 3 will provide research opportunities not available with shallower
holes.  These include comparisons between ocean crust and ophiolite complexes,
comparisons between crust formed at fast- and slow-spreading ridges, and
the distribution of metamorphism with depth in the ocean crust.  A second
objective is to study the nature of the zero-aged oceanic crust and accretion
mechanisms at the active spreading centers.  This objective requires new
bare rock spud-in technology that is being developed for the ODP.  A third
objective is the development of drilling technology to improve core recovery
and condition, and development of downhole logging techniques and in-hole
experiments to extend the usefulness of the holes.

12
ACTIVE MARGIN STUDIES

Studies of active (or convergent) ocean margins will explore the nature,
extent, and significance of the transfer of portions of oceanic lithosphere
to the continents. Creation of the continents and conversion of oceanic
crust to continental crust can be revealed through an understanding of
this process. The plate tectonics theory proposes that disposal of crust
generated at mid-ocean ridges occurs at active margins between converging
lithospheric plates. However, the process of subduction and the structure
of convergent margins are largely inferred. A primary objective of drilling
into active margins is to verify these inferences.

The major scientific problems addressed by drilling into active margins
can be summarized by four questions:

  - What processes are active at modern convergent margins and
    how do they proceed?

  - What volume of rock is strained by convergence and what
    is the time-space fluctuation of the rate of strain?

  - What are the temporal and spatial histories of island arc
    tectonics?

  - By what processes are ancient convergent margins exposed
    on land?

Many of these questions can be answered in a few critical areas by samples
from 5- to 6-km (3.1- to 3.7-mi) depths and by long-term downhole instrumen-
tation.

PASSIVE MARGIN STUDIES

Studies of passive ocean margins center on causes and mechanisms of
continental break-up and on ocean basin development. The widely accepted
model for the evolution of passive margins depicts rifting of continental
crust and seafloor spreading. However, the underlying geophysical studies
are not sufficient to verify that the model is accurate. Interpretations
of ocean-continental crust boundaries will vary until present theories
can be tested by drilling.

The genesis and evolution of sedimentary sequences in passive margins
is a second major area for intensive study. Sampling of various sediment
facies will shed light on sequences of deposition, on the initiation of
rifting and drift, and on mass movements of ocean sediments. Passive margins
offer relatively undisturbed accumulations of these sediments in contrast
to the deformed sediments associated with the active margins. The relative
global positions of active and passive margins are displayed in Figure 4.

OCEAN PALEOENVIRONMENT STUDIES

Sediments of the ocean floor contain the most complete record of the history of the earth's environment over the past 200 million years.  Examination of these sediments can help delimit the evolution of oceanic circulation, and distribution of marine life.

One specific objective is to investigate the evolution of the world ocean during the Mesozoic era. The Mesozoic is characterized by the first appearance of most of the microorganisms that provide the basis for oceanic biostratigraphy.  To allow more precise dating of the sediments and to understand world climatic changes, it is essential to know the early forms of these organisms and to understand the evolutionary changes they underwent when establishing their worldwide distribution.

A second objective is to study high-latitude paleoceanography, especially in the circum-Antarctic region. Two major elements of Cenozoic paleoceanographic evolution (i.e., the development of the circumpolar current, and the evolution of Antarctic Bottom Water, including its distribution to the deep oceans of the earth) cannot be studied without additional selected drilling in the Antarctic region. The opening of the Drake Passage is known to represent the primary structural event in the development of Southern Ocean circulation.  However, the time of the opening is not known.  Relationships between climatic changes and biogeographic changes following this new exchange between oceans might be revealed with information derived from these high-latitude studies.

Section 1.4
OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROGRAM

The advent of deep-sea drilling led to major advances in our understanding
of the earth. Not only has scientific drilling validated the concepts
of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics, but drilling results have provided
the essential physical samples with which to interpret thousands of miles
of seismic reflection records. Scientific drilling results are continuing
to provide critical evidence that will make it possible to reconstruct
the history of the earth's geology, climate, ocean circulation, and evolution
of living organisms over the past 200 million years.

The continuing importance of scientific drilling in the oceans as
a tool for acquiring geologic information is widely recognized.  Despite
recent advances in geophysical techniques, many problems remain which can
best be addressed by drilling at carefully selected locations.  Improved
knowledge of the ocean floors will provide a sound scientific basis for
the evaluation of potential hydrocarbon and other mineral resources beyond
the continental shelf, in both passive and active margin areas, well in
advance of any possible commercial activity.  The tools and expertise developed
to attain the scientific goals may well serve as a basis for the management
of such deep-sea resources as may be identified.  This work should be very
useful in setting national energy strategies and permitting establishment
of criteria for environmentally responsible development.

Understanding oceanic crust is important not only for its own sake,
but also for understanding continental crust. The relatively simple processes
of oceanic crust formation hold the clues to the much more complicated
continental crust formation. Understanding the nature and evolution of
the earth's crust and its state of stress in various tectonic settings
could contribute to better predictions of major natural geologic hazards
(e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions).

Insights into the natural variability of long-term climatic changes
and the ocean's role in those changes may be gained by seafloor exploration.
The most complete history of changes in global climate, prior to the last
few thousand years, is contained in the sediments and fossils of the ocean
floor.

Because of the broad significance of the planned program, it is not
unexpected that more than one government agency is involved in the program.
Indeed, in keeping with their missions, the U.S. Geological Survey and
the Department of Energy have shown an active interest in the ODP.  Such
interest only serves to emphasize the broad significance of the work to
the public interest and assures the central role of basic scientific research
in the continuing development of society.

CHAPTER 2

PROPOSED ACTION AND THE ALTERNATIVES

17
Section 2.1
INTRODUCTION

This chapter contains a detailed description of the proposed action,
alternatives evaluated during the course of selecting the proposed action,
and alternatives considered for environmental impact evaluation.  A summary
of the impacts of the proposed action and alternatives is presented following
these descriptions to facilitate comparison.

18
Section 2.2
PROPOSED ACTION

The proposed action (i.e., development and implementation of the ODP)
is a complex set of activities.  This section provides details on specific
components of the ODP, development of the program plan, roles of the program
participants, and specific operational details.  Activities that relate
to potential impacts of the program are emphasized. Where possible, the
reader is referred to other sources for further information.

PROGRAM COMPONENTS

The ODP components include planning, management, design, fabrication
and construction, testing, field operations, sample handling, and data
handling. Each component is summarized below.

Planning

Scientific planning for the ODP is provided primarily by the JOIDES
international scientific committee structure. The JOIDES Executive Committee
(EXCOM) sets the general policies of the program. Within the framework
of these policies the Planning Committee (PCOM) formulates plans based
on recommendations of the various JOIDES panels.  These plans then become
scientific objectives and drilling targets for the program.  ODP program
planning started in March, 1982, when the ODP proposal was approved unani-
mously by the National Science Board.  Since then, the PCOM and advisory
panels have been refining scientific plans at two levels: 1) a long-range
plan for a 9-year program of ocean drilling preceded by a 1-year planning
and ship conversion phase, and 2) a short-range plan for the early legs
of the ODP (i.e., the first 2 years).  Ship conversion is complete and
operational activities commenced in January, 1985.  Planning for subsequent
legs continues.

Management

The overall management plan for the ODP is shown in Figure 5.  The
NSF through its Ocean Drilling Program office, provides oversight and review.
Through the same office, the NSF coordinates the international ODP council
and other international membership relationships. The NSF also administers
ODP funding.  Primary management responsibility for the ODP resides with
JOI, a consortium of major oceanographic institutions in the United States.
JOI is responsible for overall management of the ODP.  In turn, JOI is
assisted by several contractors, including:

    Texas A & M University, responsible as science operator
for directing the ODP science and shipboard operations,
as well as designing and maintaining permanent laboratories
and support facilities, and curating and disseminating scientific
information.

and the Tectonophysics Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey,
responsible for new tool acquisition and modification; and 
Schlumberger Offshore Services, responsible for acquiring 
and operating routine geophysical logging tools and ship-
and shore-based logging analyses and dissemination.

Fabrication and Construction

In March, 1984, TAMU contracted with Underseas Drilling, Inc., an 
affiliate of SEDCO, Inc., of Dallas, Texas, for the charter and conversion 
of SEDCO/BP 471 (informally renamed JOIDES RESOLUTION) as the ODP drillship. 
TAMU prepared the engineering designs for the ship conversion.  Conversion 
began in October, 1984; was completed in January, 1985; and included construc-
tion of the main laboratory structure, installation of a downhole measurements 
laboratory, installation of the library and study area, construction of 
an underway geophysics laboratory, and creation of additional scientific 
office and storage space.  Major changes in the ship's drilling systems 
and equipment were also made.

Testing

The remodeled ship and the newly-fabricated drilling system were exten-
sively and successfully field-tested between January 11 and 29, 1985.  
Equipment had also been tested on land before the sea trials.

Field Operations

Operation of the drillship, including planning and implementation 
of the work at sea, is managed from the ODP science operator's headquarters 
at TAMU.  SEDCO operates the vessel under TAMU's direction.  TAMU also 
coordinates with visiting marine scientists, who are expected to take advantage 
of the drillship's long residence times (i.e., up to 30 days for riserless 
drilling, longer for riser operations) on station for studies which would 
otherwise be very costly in ship-time (e.g., intensive time-series sampling 
of the upper water column).  L-DGO will manage the wireline logging operations, 
a procedure to measure physical characteristics of rocks and sediments 
downhole by electrical, acoustical, and other means.

Sample Handling

Collection and handling of cores is an integral part of the ODP.  
Sample handling procedures for the ODP will resemble those used successfully 
for several years in the DSDP.  Detailed procedures for treatment of cores 
onboard ship, offloading at shore-based facilities, transport to the central 
repository, and curation are described in the Shipboard Scientists Handbook 
(ODP 1985).  L-DGO will provide a repository for cores obtained from the 
Atlantic and Antarctic oceans, and Mediterranean and Caribbean seas.  TAMU 
will serve as a repository for cores from the Pacific and Indian oceans.  
DSDP cores remain at the satellite repositories at L-DGO and Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, also managed by TAMU.

21
Data Handling

The ODP can be expected to generate tremendous amounts of engineering 
and scientific data. Engineering data will arise chiefly from new technological 
developments that take place as the ODP is designed and implemented. These 
data will be available as part of the public record of the program.

    Scientific data anticipated from the ODP will be mostly geological 
and geophysical. Extensive geophysical field surveys and analyses will 
be initiated well in advance of drilling, but will continue in concert 
with the drilling effort. Both regional studies and site-specific surveys 
are anticipated. In addition, physical oceanographic surveys may be conducted 
near proposed drilling sites. Data to be collected during drilling and 
in the drill hole itself will include standard well-logging information, 
other non-coring data, long-term downhole measurements involving the emplacement 
of instruments in the hole, and, possibly, measurements while drilling. 
Data from subsequent analysis of cores will be produced over a period of 
years. Each cruise of the drilling vessel is expected to generate two 
formally published scientific report volumes within 3 years following the 
cruise.  The first report will include initial core descriptions and site 
discussions. The second report will provide analyses and interpretations 
of cruise results.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

Since 1973, a series of conferences, meetings, and planning sessions 
addressing deep-sea drilling in the future have been held. These have 
resulted in the notable reports described below.

FUSOD Report

A key conference was held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in March, 1977 
to discuss "the Future of Scientific Ocean Drilling" (the FUSOD conference). 
Results are documented in the FUSOD Report (JOIDES 1977) and detail a program 
of future work that builds on the knowledge gained in the DSDP and in the 
IPOD. Subsequently, several other committees and panels were convened 
to assess and direct future drilling.

HUSOD Report

One hundred and twenty scientists and engineers met in Houston, Texas 
in March, 1980 to evaluate scientific objectives and engineering considerations 
of a program of ocean margin drilling. Results of this meeting are recorded 
in the HUSOD Report (JOI 1980).  The HUSOD Report provided the basis for 
the formal establishment of the OMDP in mid-1980 and identified priority 
objectives in ocean margin drilling. Conference participants recommended 
the use of an advanced state-of-the-art drillship and further recommended 
that the U.S. government-owned ship GLOMAR EXPLORER be converted for this 
purpose.

COSOD Report

As part of continuing scientific discussions, JOIDES initiated the 
Conference on Scientific Ocean Drilling (COSOD), held at the University
22
of Texas at Austin in November, 1981. COSOD Working Groups identified 
top priority scientific topics to address through scientific ocean drilling 
and related programs in the following decade. Recommendations are listed 
in Table 2 [see COSOD Report (JOIDES 1981) for details]. Objectives outlined 
at COSOD are now the working objectives of the ODP. To meet these objectives, 
the COSOD Working Groups recommended tools, techniques, and studies. GLOMAR 
EXPLORER was again endorsed as the preferred vessel, except that riser 
drilling capacity was postponed. The Working Groups stressed the need 
for drilling deeper into both sediment and rock, recovering a greater percentage 
of the rock cores, and maintaining or improving core condition. To enhance 
scientific returns, they suggested extensive logging in the deep oceans 
and recommended techniques for the long-term emplacement of instruments 
in the hole. Finally, the Working Groups emphasized solving geologic problems 
rather than continuing the quest for more reconnaissance information that 
characterized much of the DSDP.

Crustal Studies Report

The Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Crustal Studies was asked by the NSF 
to "review long-range plans for crustal studies within the university-based 
earth and ocean sciences." In addition, the group was asked to "assign 
relative priorities to initiatives in crustal studies ... with particular 
attention to the relative priority to be assigned to ocean drilling" and 
"... to advise on the relative merits of CHALLENGER, EXPLORER, or a third 
platform." The Ad Hoc Advisory Group presented its report to the NSF in 
April, 1983 and recommended that nine initiatives be pursued to meet the 
goals of a crustal studies program [see The Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Crustal 
Studies (NSF 1983), for details]. The group endorsed a long-term international 
program of ocean drilling as an essential part of that effort. The group 
also recommended the use of a commercial, dynamically positioned drillship, 
which, due to the world oil situation, had become economically feasible 
to lease. This latest development, coupled with the science objectives 
laid out at COSOD, formed the operational guidelines of the ODP.

PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS

The ODP combines the participation of the Federal government, the 
academic community, and several international participants. Given the 
technical and scientific complexity of the ODP, this diversification and 
range of skills is a strength. Roles of program participants are described 
below.

Role of the National Science Foundation

The ODP, like the DSDP, has its roots in the research interests of 
the academic community. The NSF is the lead agency for Federal support 
of this kind of research and the primary Federal focus for program development. 
The NSF Director and the National Science Board have joint responsibility 
and authority for all NSF programs.

The ODP is part of the Oceanographic Centers and Facilities Section, 
Division of Ocean Sciences, Directorate for Astronomical, Atmospheric, 
Earth and Ocean Sciences (see Figure 6). An ODP office was formed at the 
NSF to administer the program and associated efforts. The Program Director

oversees and administers contractual arrangements with JOI and relationships 
with international members of JOIDES while maintaining close liason with 
ODP contractors and the JOIDES advisory structure.  The Program Director 
also administers funding for unsolicited research proposals in topics related 
to ocean drilling.

Role of the Management Contractor

JOI manages the ODP under contract to the NSF. JOI was established 
in 1976 to focus the collective capabilities of individual U.S. oceanographic 
institutions (i.e., the 10 U.S. members of JOIDES, see Section 1.2) on 
large oceanographic research projects and to provide a contractually responsible 
party for such activities. Three major functions of the ODP are coordinated 
by JOI: long-term scientific direction (subcontracted to the JOIDES office; 
see Section 1.2 and Role of International Participants, this section), 
scientific and drillship operations (subcontracted to TAMU; see Role of 
Science Operator, this section), and logging services (subcontracted to 
L-DGO).

Role of the Science Operator

TAMU was designated in March, 1984, as the ODP science operator. 
Acting under the guidance of the JOIDES PCOM, the tasks of the science 
operator are to:

  Provide shipboard science management and technical supervision

  Obtain geophysical, oceanographic, and meteorological data 
for safety review and final site selection affected by opera-
tional constraints

  Develop an efficient ship schedule and procure proper clearances, 
drilling permits, etc.

  Develop operational plans, ensure equipment availability, 
define operational limitations, and provide an adequate 
supply of consumables (e.g., beacons, reentry cones, drill 
bits, etc.)

  Assess safety and operational procedures prior to drilling 
by considering recomendations of the JOIDES Pollution Prevention 
and Safety Panel, an internal (i.e., TAMU) Safety Review 
Committee, and an internal engineering panel

  Store, archive, and disseminate cores and other scientific 
data

  Disseminate public information; educational materials; publi-
cation of cruise proceedings volumes; and engineering develop-
ments of the program.

As science operator, TAMU is also responsible for the following drillship-
related tasks:

26
- Design, furnishing, and maintenance of scientific, lodging,
and recreational facilities for the shipboard science staff

- Improvement of existing drilling and downhole technologies
and development of new ones to meet scientific goals of
the program

- Staffing the scientific and technical support crews (e.g.,
shipboard scientists, electronics and marine technicians,
experienced drilling operations manager)

- Logistics of the drilling program.

Role of the Vessel Operator

JOIDES RESOLUTION is owned by SEDCO and British Petroleum, Ltd., through
Overseas Drilling, Ltd. SEDCO operates the vessel under TAMU's direction.
They supply the drill crew and all personnel to run the vessel. The captain
of the ship has final authority concerning safety of the ship and its crew.
A TAMU shipboard Drilling Operations Manager is assigned to each cruise
in addition to the SEDCO personnel. The Drilling Operations Manager is
experienced in offshore drilling operations; knowledgeable of ODP policies,
procedures, and guidelines; and familiar with the ship contractor's mode
of operation. In addition to serving as liaison among drilling, scientific,
ship contractor, and logging operations, the Drilling Operations Manager
oversees technical aspects of drilling, coring, instrumentation and mechanical
operations; acts as chief safety officer; serves as principal technical
advisor to the chief scientists; and participates in decisions that deviate
from planned operations.

Role of the Academic Community

The ODP is a program of basic scientific research with active participation
from the academic community. Most members of the scientific advisory body
JOIDES come from the academic community, with some participation from scientists
in governmental agencies and private industry.  As described earlier in
this section, the JOIDES PCOM develops scientific objectives and drilling
targets for the ODP, normally by coordinating, consolidating, and setting
into priority the advice of its panels and working groups (see Figure 7).
Through this process, the academic community has the major role in ODP
scientific planning.

Role of International Participants

Of the approximately 180 scientists participating in JOIDES committee
and panel activities, one-half are from non-U.S. institutions.  JOIDES'
international participants include the European Science Foundation (a consortium
of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
and Switzerland) and ocean research institutions from Canada, France, Germany,
Japan, and the United Kingdom. As of May, 1985, there were three regular
members of the ODP making full financial contributions (i.e., Canada, France,
and the Federal Republic of Germany), and three candidate members (i.e.,
the European Science Foundation, Japan, and the U.K.). Each full member
agrees in principle to take part in a decade-long program and to provide

a share of operating support ($2.5 million is the base for FY 1985; shares will be indexed for inflation over the life of the program).

Another feature of the ODP organizational structure is the International Council, the only body in which members are represented as countries rather than scientific organizations. All countries, whether participating as individual members or as part of a consortium, are members of this council. Although only a consultative body, the International Council permits organizations that provide financial support for the ODP an opportunity to discuss the program's status and direction.

Liaison Between Program Participants

The NSF maintains the necessary links between all participants in the program (see Figure 6). The Ocean Drilling Program office in the NSF's Ocean Sciences Division has primary responsibility for this coordination.

SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM

The science objectives of the ODP are discussed in Section 1.3. Drilling plans to meet the objectives are in preparation by the panels and committees of JOIDES. These plans are being designed to fit into a schedule built around high latitude "weather windows" in the North Atlantic during the summer of 1985 and in the Antarctic during the austral summer of 1986-1987.

Proposed Drilling Locations

The candidate drill sites for the first 2 years of the drilling program are presented in Figure 8. Specific plans are made 1 year in advance of drilling operations. The first 14 legs of the ODP are listed in Table 3. As of June, 1985, the drilling schedule had been confirmed for the first six legs. Under tentative long-range plans, the vessel will proceed to the Indian Ocean in 1987, the northwest Pacific Ocean in mid-1989, the northeast Pacific Ocean in mid-1990, and the vicinity of Panama on about January 1, 1991. Future drill sites under consideration are indicated in Figure 9.

Drilling Platform

JOIDES RESOLUTION is the ODP drilling platform. It is a modern, technologically up-to-date, dynamically positioned ship that is acknowledged to be among the world's best drillships (Figure 10). With conversions for the ODP [i.e., addition of lab space, the adaptation of drilling equipment to maximize coring efficiency, and the upgrading of drilling equipment to handle a 9,000-m (29,520-ft) drill string], the ship now offers capabilities particularly well-suited for scientific drilling:

- Lab Space - 1,009 m2 (10,900 ft2) of dedicated laboratory space is available. Specific laboratory space is allocated to paleomagnetics, paleontology, petrology, chemistry, physical properties, and underway geophysics. There is also a library, logging lab, meteorology center, photography lab, computer

232 m2 (2,500 ft2) is dedicated to scientific storage.

  •  High Latitude Drilling - The ship is ice-strengthened and 
capable of high-latitude operations, permitting drilling 
in regions previously not accessible.

  •  Core Bit Stability - The ability to obtain undisturbed core 
samples is directly related to stability of the bottom hole 
assembly. The ship has a relatively large displacement, 
good surface stability, a modern drill string heave compensator, 
and a computer-controlled dynamic positioning system coupled 
with a responsive and powerful thruster system.  This enables 
the ship to keep position precisely over the drill hole 
and keep the drill bit in firm contact with the bottom of 
the hole.

  •  Penetration - Deep penetrations require the ability to stay 
on station for a long time, an efficient drill rig, drilling 
mud to strengthen and maintain the walls of the hole, and 
casing to prevent the hole from caving in. JOIDES RESOLUTION'S 
size and equipment provide these capabilities.  Ultimately, 
a 2,000-m (6,560-ft) riser and blowout preventer may be 
employed.

  •  Long drill string - JOIDES RESOLUTION can deploy a 9,000-m 
(29,520-ft) drill string.

  •  Quarters - A 50-person scientific crew can be accommodated, 
nearly double the space aboard GLOMAR CHALLENGER.  The increased 
scientific berthing enables greater participation by inter-
national scientists, graduate students, and others.

Specifications of JOIDES RESOLUTION and the previous drillship, GLOMAR 
CHALLENGER, are listed in Table 4.

Drilling Procedures

Scientific Coring vs. Oilfield Drilling--

Although similar principles of drilling practice apply for both industrial 
and scientific drilling, there are important differences in equipment and 
procedures.  In oilfield drilling, the prime objective is to reach the 
target depth as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Logging and coring 
are done only as appropriate.  In scientific drilling, reaching target 
depth is desirable, but of secondary importance compared to understanding 
the composition and properties of the intervening strata in the earth's 
crust.  This objective requires nearly continuous coring and logging, and, 
the recovered cores must remain undisturbed.  In addition, drilling and 
coring of the oceanic basement (usually basalt) are also required.  Hence, 
scientific drilling may take considerably longer than commercial drilling 
to achieve the same penetration depth (Sutherland and McLerran 1984).

Most known offshore hydrocarbon concentrations are located along the continental margins, under thick layers of sediments, in relatively shallow water, where oilfield drilling is concentrated.  Scientific drilling probes unknown parts of the ocean.  Because of this, extensive geophysical surveying and data analysis are required to select scientific drilling sites, even when located in deep ocean plains and basins -- regions devoid of the formations in which oil and gas are typically found.  Rigorous safety considerations are included in the pre-drilling routine.  During drilling, sediments are carefully examined for traces of oil, methane, or other hydrocarbon indicators as well as H_(2)S.  If any are found, drilling is suspended and the hole is immediately capped (Sutherland and McLerran 1984).  These procedures, used throughout the DSDP and to be used during the ODP, are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

Riserless vs. Riser Drilling--

Past experience in scientific drilling has been limited to riserless drilling.  The early goals of the DSDP were to provide worldwide reconnaissance of the seafloor by drilling and coring numerous relatively shallow holes in deep water.  Use of a riser is typically not necessary for shallow penetrations in deep water, and is economically prohibitive on a large scale. Riserless operations permit rapid set up and break-down, and facilitate drilling many holes in widely separated locations.  Nevertheless, future scientific drilling objectives are expected to require occasional use of a riser and subsea equipment, as the ocean margins become increasingly important targets for scientific research.

All commercial offshore exploratory, development, and production drilling requires the use of a riser and blowout preventer (BOP).  The riser is a large-diameter pipe surrounding the drill pipe.  It extends from the ship to the seafloor and creates an annular space between itself and the external diameter of the drill pipe.  The BOP, located at the seafloor, is attached between the riser and casing that has been cemented into the drill hole in the seafloor.  The BOP has pipe rams, which can form a seal around the drill pipe and shear rams, which can be activated from the surface in an emergency to cut through the drill pipe and seal off all flow from the hole.

In drilling a riser hole, a fluid chemical mixture (called mud) is used to control formation pressures.  The density of mud can be carefully controlled.  It is pumped down the center of the hollow drill pipe.  The mud exits through holes in the drill bit and flows back up to the ship through the annulus between the drill pipe and the riser and casing.  The mud carries drilling cuttings, lubricates the hole, and facilitates hole stability, thus helping the drill pipe to penetrate deeply into the ocean floor.  This system also permits drilling through overpressured zones which can be encountered in thick sedimentary sequences (Sutherland and McLerran 1984).

If an overpressure zone is penetrated, a device in the BOP (called a preventer) is remotely closed.  It stops the flow in the annular space between the drill pipe and casing.  The density of the mud at the surface is increased, and pumped down the drill pipe, through the bit, and up the hole to the BOP.  There the mud is remotely shunted into small-diameter

36
conduits (called choke and kill lines) which carry the higher density mud back to the drillship. This higher density creates sufficient counterpressure in the well to overcome and balance the overpressure.

Deep Drilling vs. Shallow Drilling--

Typically, scientific drill sites are in water deeper than 3,000 m 
(9,840 ft). Working in these depths requires the use of dynamic positioning,
and acoustic stationkeeping; conventional mooring is not feasible. Drill 
string reentry systems also must be specially designed for the depths en-
countered in scientific drilling.

In commercial drilling, which is typically in shallow water, the drilling 
equipment and suspension system gradually experiences an increasing load 
as the drill penetrates into the seafloor. Drilling equipment is usually 
subject to an average load about one-half to two-thirds of the maximum 
load experienced in drilling each hole. This is not the case in deep water 
with shallow penetration. The load experienced at the start of drilling 
is usually only slightly below the final maximum load. Because scientific 
drilling components operate at much higher average loads than do commercial 
components, they are susceptible to increased wear and stress, and require 
more powerful and rugged equipment.

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Numerous laws and regulations apply to the general construction and 
operation of offshore drilling vessels. Some statutes apply only to vessels 
working in U.S. or other coastal nations waters on the continental shelf. 
Many rules also apply to ships operating in international waters.  This 
section describes statutes and regulations most likely to affect the ODP. 
As the program has developed, these requirements have been carefully studied 
to ensure that JOIDES RESOLUTION complies with all existing national and 
international laws.

All vessels operating in U.S. waters must comply with U.S. Coast Guard 
regulations for certification, inspection, safety, and design of equipment. 
The Coast Guard is the primary enforcement agent for Federal ship safety 
laws and for pollution abatement regulations pertaining to ship-generated 
pollutants. The agency maintains a specialized staff to enforce these 
regulations throughout the United States and at selected overseas ports.

JOIDES RESOLUTION was built to comply with the International Convention 
for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Rules, 1974.  The vessel was also 
built under classification by the American Bureau of Shipping under the 
Rules for Building and Classing of Offshore Mobile Drilling Units, 1973, 
and Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels, 1974.  These rules apply 
primarily to the hull structure, main propulsion machinery, and main auxilliary 
equipment required for safe vessel operation. JOIDES RESOLUTION is classified 
by the American Bureau of Shipping as a Category A-1 drilling unit and 
is approved for unrestricted ocean service.  Reclassification because of 
conversion operations is unnecessary. The ship complies with all regulations 
for electrical engineering, marine engineering, load lines, and pollution 
control. JOIDES RESOLUTION is certificated under Liberian government maritime 
rules and regulations.

37
Special rules and regulations apply to ship-generated pollutants.
The International Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) has adopted
special requirements for the control of pollution from drilling vessels
that address oily discharges from the ship and establish maximum concentrations
for the release of undiluted discharges.

In accordance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA),
and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), the Environ-
mental Protection Agency has established regulations for the discharge
and dumping of pollutants such as sewage, solid wastes, oil, and drilling
muds. Some of these regulations may apply to the ODP operations. National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) provisions of the amended
FWPCA apply to point source discharges from vessels engaged in drilling
operations, but these regulations are legally binding only in U.S. waters.
When operations are conducted in waters outside of the U.S., the NPDES
provisions will serve as a guide.

The U.S. Geological Survey regulates all drilling activity on the
U.S. continental shelf through a series of operating orders. These regulations
are contained in the "Revised Outer Continental Shelf Orders Governing
Oil and Gas Lease Operations," dated December 21, 1979 and will be observed
when JOIDES RESOLUTION operates in waters under USGS jurisdiction. However,
one provision of these rules is that the Federal government does not need
to issue permits to itself for operations in U.S. waters.

When operating within the territorial waters of another country, full
compliance will be sought with the applicable laws and regulations of that
country. Under international law, as reflected in the 1982 Convention
on Law of the Sea, drilling within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or
on the continental shelf of a coastal nation, requires that country's prior
consent. The Office of Marine Science and Technology Affairs in the U.S.
Department of State is the principal liaison between the science operator
and other coastal nations.

Activities in the Antarctic (an important element of the ODP) are
governed by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, recommendations adopted under
the treaty, and the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978. The Antarctic
Treaty provides for freedom of access for scientific work south of the
600 S latitude. The ODP's proposed scientific research drilling with free
availability of the data retrieved differentiates it from resource prospecting
which is voluntarily restrained under a 1977 treaty agreement on mineral
resource exploration and exploitation (Treaty Recommendation IX-10). NSF's
Division of Polar Programs, by annual transmittal of planned activities
through diplomatic channels, will provide advance notice of Antarctic drilling
operations to the governments of all other Antarctic Treaty signatories
and to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR is the primary
scientific advisory body to the treaty nation). This EIS and information
on planned research synopsis, ship's tracks, and participating scientists
will be compiled and made available as required by Treaty Article VII(5).
Thus, proposed ODP activities are consistent with the Antarctic Treaty
and with the policy of voluntary restraint from mineral exploration in
Antarctica.

38
Article II of the Convention on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR) of 1980 establishes a "conservation standard" to protect 
Antarctic marine living resources.  The CCAMLR, and U.S. legislation imple-
menting it (which took effect in 1982), have effect in the ocean areas 
south of the Antarctic Convergence.  The stringent conservation standards 
are utilized to scrutinize the proposed drilling activity in the Antarctic. 
ODP operations in the Antarctic are guided by the CCAMLR regulations outlined 
in the Antarctic Program Personnel Manual (NSF 1984).

Section 2.3
ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED ACTION

EXTERNAL PROGRAM ALTERNATIVES

No Action

Scientific objectives of the ODP have been established through extensive review by the scientific community and are based upon the findings of past deep-sea drilling. Many individuals and advisory groups (e.g., Committee on Post-IPOD Science 1979; JOIDES 1977; Marine Board, National Academy of Sciences 1978) have considered whether the scientific goals of ocean exploration can be achieved by means other than drilling at extreme depths. The consensus is that there is no alternative.

Curtailling implementation of the ODP will only delay attainment of program goals.  The timeliness and importance of the ODP have been identified in Chapter 1, and the potential growth in scientific information is compelling. Cancelling the program would postpone development of our understanding of the earth and would significantly reduce the chances that deep-sea resource development will be orderly and enlightened. Therefore, the NSF has rejected this alternative.

Program Deferral

Complete program deferral would not be appropriate because a five-year commitment of resources has already been made by the U.S. and several other countries, and the ship is already operating.  Deferral would therefore result in ship expenses without the return of scientific information. In additon, ODP drilling procedures for the foreseeable future are identical to those used during the DSDP. The EIS for the DSDP/IPOD (NSF 1975) concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts from these procedures. Because complete program deferral would have financial disadvantages and no apparent environmental advantages, the NSF has rejected this alterna-tive.

The ODP could be partially deferred by implementing new drilling technology (e.g., bare rock spud-in, logging tools, long-term downhole instrumentation) later than is now planned.  This alternative offers no apparent environmental advantages, as implementation of new technologies is not expected to affect environmental impacts discussed in Chapter 4 or in the DSDP/IPOD EIS (NSF 1975).

Geophysical Surveys

Geophysical surveys of selected regions within ocean basins and continen-tal margins can yield significant information. However, analysis of cores retrieved during the DSDP has shown that interpretation of geophysical data is often faulty. Without drilling in these areas, structure and composi-tion would still be a matter of conjecture. In addition, information obtainable only from drilling (e.g., geochemistry, physical properties, paleoceanography) 

40
would be forfeited (JOI 1979, 1980). New information gathered from this 
alternative would meet few, if any, of the scientific objectives.

INTERNAL PROGRAM ALTERNATIVES

During program development, many design, drilling platform, and drilling 
system alternatives were evaluated. For example, alternatives considered 
for a drilling platform included semisubmersibles, submarines, and ships. 
Decisions were based on engineering and environmental considerations. 
The major internal program alternative is to drill only in areas not requiring 
a riser. However, this would put regions of considerable scientific interest 
out of reach of the ODP. The environmental consequences of this alternative 
are addressed in the impact evaluation, Chapter 4.

OPERATIONAL ALTERNATIVES

Planning and scheduling ODP drilling is a continuous process. Operational 
alternatives exist in the form of decisions on drill sites and schedules. 
Such decisions are made by assessing the degrees of risk and the probabilities 
of success for individual holes. Logistics (e.g., the proximity of sites 
to each other), the cooperation of coastal nations, and seasonal variations 
in physical and biological processes also influence operational scheduling. 
These operational alternatives are addressed in the impact evaluation, 
Chapter 4.

 
                                                                             41
SECTION 2.4
SUMMARY OF IMPACTS FOR PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

The impact assessment focuses on representative drill sites encompassing
the range of scientific goals, geographic positions, and ecologic conditions
expected during the ODP. Internal program alternatives, involving riserless
and riser drilling, are evaluated. Operational alternatives, dealing with
site locations, well planning, drilling procedures, and drilling schedules,
are also analyzed.

Principally, ODP program elements occur at sea, and the analysis of
environmental impacts centers on the ocean environment.  Key program activities
and elements that impact the environment include:

  • Presence of the ship and drill string
  • Release of drilling fluids and cuttings
  • Potential oil and gas spills and blowouts
  • Noise from drillship and drilling operations.

Table 5 summarizes impacts associated with areas of the proposed action.
The ODP activity and the resulting portion of environment impacted are
identified.  Where an impact is identified, three aspects of the impact
are assigned values or ratings.  These aspects are: magnitude (or degree
of change related to the impact), persistence (length of time the impact
lasts), and probability (degree of likelihood that the impact will occur).
Detailed description of these impacts is also indexed in Table 5.

IMPACT SUMMARY

The following provides a summary discussion of impacts associated
with the proposed action and its internal alternatives.  Terms used in
description of impacts include negligible (limited in extent or range,
with recovery in a short time period, as to not cause a measurable difference
or decrease in a habitat or population) and minor (probability of occurrence
or extent increased and/or recovery time extended but not expected to have
population level impacts).

Impact of the Environment on the ODP

The environment will exert a considerable influence on the ODP, par-
ticularly in the area of drilling and field operations.  High winds at
a drilling site can force the drillship off station, damage the drilling
system, or force abandonment of the drilling operation.  At some drilling
locations, extreme sea ice conditions can adversely affect station-keeping
capabilities. Geological conditions of the formations to be drilled affect
site selection and well planning, and could damage the drilling system.

Impact of the ODP on the Physical Environment

The operation of the drillship, air planes, and helicopters through 
the burning of fuel, the burning of refuse, and venting of laboratory solvent 
gases will locally increase air pollutant emissions.  This is expected 
to be a temporary, minor impact on ambient air quality.

Riserless drilling discharges to the ocean floor of surface seawater, 
drilling mud, and cuttings will result in slight increases in temperature, 
oxygen, nutrients, dissolved gases, and suspended particulates.  These 
minor water quality impacts are expected to be localized to the drill site. 
Water quality impacts from riser drilling will be limited to within 100 m 
(328 ft) of the drillship for elevated metals concentrations and 1,000 m 
(3,280 ft) for elevated suspended solids concentrations during discharge 
of muds and cuttings.  These are considered temporary, minor impacts to 
water quality.

The seafloor will be impacted by the deposition of drilling muds and 
cuttings, surface casing and reentry cone assemblies, and dynamic positioning 
beacons.  Impacts from metal structures or their breakdown products are 
minor.  Muds and cuttings from riserless drilling accumulate in the immediate 
vicinity of the borehole.  This results in local alteration of sediment 
characteristics and modification of bottom topography.  Accumulation of 
drilling muds and cuttings less than 0.02 mm are predicted for riser drilling 
operations at any one location.  This accumulation is expected to result 
in negligible impacts on the seafloor.

ODP operations will result in negligible impact to the terrestrial 
acoustical environment.  Noise levels in the ocean will be significantly 
elevated through the lower frequency range in the vicinity of operations. 
The noise is similar to that produced by moderate vessel traffic and should 
produce a temporary, minor impact on the acoustical environment.

Impact of the ODP on the Biological Environment

With riserless drilling operations, drilling muds and cuttings will 
be discharged onto the seafloor.  Thus, no impacts on phytoplankton and 
zooplankton populations are expected.  Potential impacts to demersal nektonic 
organisms include the smothering of demersal eggs, acute and chronic toxicity, 
bioaccumulation, and indirect effects through food supply reduction.  However, 
these are expected to be localized in the vicinity of the borehole, short-
term, and therefore negligible.  Benthic communities are expected to be 
affected.  However, the size of the area will be negligible compared with 
the size of the ecosystem.

With riser drilling operations, surface discharges of drilling muds 
and cuttings are expected to have little (if any) impact on phytoplankton 
and zooplankton because of the brief, intermittent nature of the discharge, 
rapid dilution, and rapid population recovery.  Impacts to demersal fishes 
are expected to be negligible.  Negligible changes in benthic species com-
position and abundance are expected.

The drillship, either in transit or on station, could interfere with 
marine mammal movements.  However, this interference is unlikely to have 
44
any significant impacts.  Noise produced by ODP activities could disturb 
marine mammals or interfere with their vocalization.  However, the overall 
effect is considered negligible.  Surface discharges from the drillship 
could elicit avoidance reactions by marine mammals or have short-term affects 
on their food sources.  With riserless drilling, muds and cuttings discharged 
on the seafloor will have no effect on marine mammals.  Indirect effects 
on marine mammals (e.g., reduction of food organisms or bioaccumulation) 
are unlikely because effects on plankton and fish are expected to be localized 
and short-term, and the resulting secondary effects on marine mammal predators 
should be negligible.

Various discharges of the ODP could potentially affect marine birds 
through direct effects on birds on or in the water, or through indirect 
effects on fish or plankton on which birds feed.  Discharges from the drillship 
occur in a very localized area.  Thus, there should be negligible direct 
physical or toxicological effects on marine birds.  The effects of ODP 
discharges on fish and zooplankton are expected to be minor and very localized, 
so that resulting indirect effects on marine birds will also be negligible. 
The ODP could also affect marine birds through disturbances of colonies 
by helicopter overflights.  However these disturbances are expected to 
be very infrequent and temporary, and any induced egg mortality should 
have no significant adverse effects on the population.

Previously, it was concluded that the ODP would have negligible impacts 
on marine mammals and birds, and this generally would apply to endangered 
and threatened species of those groups.  Their reduced population or limited 
ranges magnify any effects.  However, these would only be temporary.  The 
ODP could affect sea turtles through direct and indirect effects of various 
discharges, and through collisions between sea turtles and the drillship. 
ODP discharges are expected to affect water quality in a minor and localized 
manner, and so would potentially impact relatively few sea turtles.  In 
addition, collision situations will be rare, with only one ship involved 
and the low density of turtles in the open sea.  The resulting effects 
on turtle populations are therefore expected to be negligible.

Biologically sensitive areas involving the terrestrial environment, 
ice-edge communities, and rookeries of marine mammals and birds will be 
negligibly affected, since ODP activities are located far offshore.  Bio-
logically sensitive features involving productive fish populations and 
commercial fisheries are not expected to be significantly impacted by the 
ODP.

Impact of the ODP on the Social, Economic, and Legal Environment

Direct ODP expenditures on payroll, goods, and materials have brought 
and will continue to bring economic benefits to program activity locales. 
By creating other jobs and new cycle of expenditures, fusion of that money 
into the local economies has had and will continue to have a multiplier 
effect in the regional economics of program locales.

Since the ODP will involve only one ship and drilling will not be 
conducted for the more than 3 months in any given area, it is unlikely 
that the program would have significant adverse effects on commercial fisheries,

45
military operations, transportation resource development, and other scientific 
research.

ODP activities in other coastal nations requires consent of that nation, 
but this is expected with little difficulty.  Drilling activities in the 
Antarctic are to be conducted in compliance with applicable international 
treaty provisions.

Significant technology development and transfer is involved with the 
ODP. Technology advances include a modern state-of-the-art drillship, 
complete program of scientific logging, and improved drilling and coring 
techniques. These advances will be openly available to the countries partici-
pating in the ODP as well as the petroleum industry.

Mishaps and Accidents

Mishaps and accidents occasionally occur in drilling operations. 
Mishaps could result from storms, unexpected geologic anomalies, or blowouts. 
Most resulting impacts would be caused by material fluxes into the environment. 
Storms or geological conditions could result in the loss of the drill string 
(riserless drilling) or riser and drill string (riser drilling), and all 
downhole or subsea equipment in use at the time.  Following such a loss, 
failure to plug the hole (if conditions monitored during the earlier drilling 
suggested it was necessary) may result in chronic exchange of formation 
fluids and seawater. Depending on the direction of flow and composition 
of formation fluid, impacts could range between none and a persistent exchange 
of local bottom water with formation fluids that are toxic to the local 
benthic community. However, the probability of releasing substantial volumes 
of subsurface aqueous solutions is small and the impacts are expected to 
be localized and minor.

While the probability of a blowout of pressurized gas or formation 
fluids is unlikely, a blowout could result in the loss of downhole equipment 
and a continuing release of gas (including H_(2)S) or formation fluids into 
the water column.  The portion reaching the surface (low molecular weight 
gases, including H_(2)S) would be released into the atmosphere, impacting 
air quality. Depending on the composition and persistence of the released 
accumulations, impacts could range from none to a continuing introduction 
of material toxic to the local bottom and demersal communities.  Site review 
and safety procedures minimize the potential of release of significant 
volumes of gas and formation fluids into the marine environment.

The worst-case scenario (i.e., an uncontrolled blowout of hydrocarbons 
and the loss of the ship) would result in release of oil into the marine 
environment until another drillship could drill a relief well. Impacts 
to pelagic organisms in contact with oil include death caused by lethal 
toxic effects, altered physiology or behavior caused by sublethal toxic 
effects, tainting due to oil uptake, bioaccumulation or biomagnification, 
and smothering and suffocation.

Plankton populations would be extensively impacted in the vicinity 
of the spill. Adverse impacts are likely to be short-term and localized. 
Most nektonic organisms can avoid the spill, reducing impacts on these 
populations. Toxicity to eggs, larvae, and juveniles could impact fishes

46
and fisheries, resulting in long-term population reductions.  Significant 
toxic effects or smothering of benthic organisms could occur where oil 
is incorporated into the sediments.  This should occur in high concentrations 
only in the vicinity of the blowout.

Impacts from an oil spill to marine mammals will be greatest on species 
that rely on fur or hair for insulation or that have greatly reduced popu-
lations.  Foraging techniques and migratory concentrations also increase 
vulnerability. Low densities associated with pelagic distributions reduce 
impacts at the population level and impacts should be negligible to moderate.

Effects of oil on pelagic marine birds include mortality or disablement 
from fouling of plumage, toxic effects, and food losses.  Factors affecting 
the likelihood of impacts include how much time a species spends on the 
water and how it forages. The increased densities found at rich foraging 
areas also increase vulnerability to impacts.  Penguins are especially 
vulnerable, since they rely on their feathers for insulation.  Depending 
on location, impacts can range from negligible to moderate.

Due to the distance of most drill sites from landfall, oil impacts 
to the more sensitive coastal, ice edge, and shoreline habitats are reduced. 
Dispersion and weathering of oil before reaching these habitats, if these 
habitat are reached at all, will greatly reduce its volume and toxicity. 
Impacts from spills to these habitats and the organisms associated with 
them should only be minor. Biologically sensitive regions and areas of 
concentrations of endangered and threatened species occur almost exclusively 
in these coastal zones, thereby reducing potential impacts from oil spills.

Spill prevention and cleanup procedures are expected to have negligible 
impacts on the environment.  Any impacts from these operations will be 
more than offset by the reduction of oil-related impacts to the environment.

COMPARISON OF IMPACTS

Comparison of impacts of the program alternatives was addressed in 
the DSDP/IPOD EIS (NSF 1975).  The comparison of impacts from operational 
alternatives, including site location, drilling schedule, and well planning, 
is an ongoing process throughout the program.  A series of panels reviews 
alternatives to ensure safe operation and to minimize occurrence of potential 
environmentally damaging situations. The remaining internal program alternative 
to be acted upon is the future conversion to riser drilling capability. 
The main difference in environmental impacts between operation of riserless 
and riser drilling is the location of the discharge of drilling fluids 
and cuttings.  The comparison of impacts of riserless and riser drilling 
is discussed below.

Riserless Drilling Operations

Riserless drilling operations will result in the discharge of surface 
seawater, drilling muds, and cuttings on the seafloor.  Because these are 
not discharged into the water column, no impacts to pelagic planktonic 
and nektonic organisms (including marine mammals and birds) are expected. 
Potential impacts to demersal nektonic organisms and benthos include smothering 
of demersal eggs and benthos, acute and chronic toxicity, bioaccumulation,

47
and secondary effects through food supply reduction and change in substrate 
characteristics.  These are expected to be localized in the vicinity of 
the borehole, short-term, and therefore negligible.

Riser Drilling Operations

    Riser drilling operations will result in the discharge of drilling 
mud and cuttings to surface waters.  Due to the depths of most drill sites, 
impacts to demersal fish and benthic organisms are expected to be negligible. 
Impacts on plankton will be localized and minor because of the brief, inter-
mittent nature of the discharge, rapid dilution, and rapid population recovery. 
Impacts to pelagic nekton (including marine mammals and birds) include 
localized reduction of food supply and possible ingestion of toxic particles. 
Impacts are considered negligible because of their localized, intermittent 
nature and because many pelagic organisms can avoid discharge plumes.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

    ODP operations should result in negligible cumulative impacts above 
those already stated when considered together with effects of other operations 
occurring simultaneously in the same region.  Interaction or overlap with 
other operations will be minimal, resulting in few, if any, regions where 
overlap of effects would cause a measurable difference in impacts to the 
marine environment.  This primarily results from the remote locations and 
short-term occupation of drilling sites and the localized and temporary 
impacts attributed to ODP operations.

    Cumulative impacts projected for the duration of the program will 
also be negligible.  The localized and short duration of most perturbations 
to the environment results in a negligible impact when viewed at the longer 
time scale of the complete program.  The geographical separation of drilling 
locations further reduces the cumulative effects.  In addition, the percentage 
of any habitat that will be impacted over the course of the program is 
only a very small fraction of the total.  In effect, the localized nature 
and short-term scale of impacts at each drill site precludes any cumulative 
impacts that could occur over the course of the ODP.

CHAPTER 3
AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Section 3.1
INTRODUCTION

The description of the environment affected by the ODP focuses on
four representative drilling sites. Together they encompass the full range
of scientific goals, geographic positions, and geologic and ecologic conditions
expected during the ODP. The selection process by which the sites were
chosen began with a review of the program's major scientific goals, as
outlined by JOIDES. Potential drill sites were then evaluated by three
criteria to identify sites that would represent the range of potential
environmental impacts.  The three criteria were:

•  Environmental factors at each site
•  Risk elements of site location
•  Data availability.

Four sites were selected, as indicated in Figure 11 and Table 6.  Potential
impacts are also noted in Table 6.  Although individual impacts are emphasized
herein under only one site, they are also possible at others.  Thus, important
variations of potential impacts that could result at other locations are
discussed as appropriate.  In this way, the full range of potential effects
is addressed under the four representative sites.

FEATURES OF THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAY AFFECT THE ODP

WEATHER

Weather affects all operational aspects of the ODP. Logistics can be affected by inclement weather.  The design of the ship drill floor allows drilling activities under all weather conditions, except when the ship cannot physically be held on station.  Drilling activities have been scheduled to minimize encounters with seasonal and extreme weather conditions (e.g., hurricanes, storms, sea ice).

SEA CONDITIONS

Sea conditions affect all ship-based operations.  Drilling is postponed or suspended when the sea state exceeds the limits of the drill string compensation system; subsurface currents generate shear forces beyond design limits of the drill string or riser; surface currents exceed the station-keeping capability of the dynamic positioning system; or high seas limit the at-sea transfer of equipment or personnel by ship or helicopter.

GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS

Geologic conditions can affect site locations, well design, and, under certain conditions, the drill assembly. Unstable surface sediments, faults, or overpressure zones could cause loss of the downhole assembly, drill string, or worse. As indicated in Chapter 2, drill sites are carefully chosen on the basis of both geologic conditions that minimize such risks and scientific importance. Mitigating measures used by the ODP to reduce geologic risks are discussed in Section 4.8.

Section 3.3
FEATURES OF THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE ODP

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE DRILLING AREAS

Weddell Sea

The Weddell Sea, part of the Southern Ocean, lies to the east of the 
Antarctic Penninsula between 50° and 10° W longitude (Figure 12).  This 
deep basin [greater than 4,000 m (12,832 ft) in many places] is topographically 
isolated by the Scotia Rise to the north and by the Maud Rise to the west. 
The basin extends into the Antarctic continent to within 10° of the South 
Pole.  Shallower portions of the continental shelf along the peninsula 
and in the southern area are covered with shelf ice throughout the year. 
This ice sheet usually covers the entire Weddell Sea during the austral 
winter, retreating from east to west over the austral summer.  Due to the 
ice coverage, drilling is feasible during only the austral summer.  Drilling 
in the Weddell Sea (LEG 114) is scheduled for mid-January through February, 
1987.

Meteorology--

Weather in the Weddell Sea is dominated by a persistent low pressure 
system over the eastern part of the sea.  Its position and strength are 
important to sea-ice growth and decay because of resulting equatorward 
airflow over the western portion of the sea.  The expected mean surface 
geostrophic winds generated by barometric pressure fields during the projected 
drilling period are shown in Figure 13.  The important features are weak 
clockwise circulation in the Weddell Sea, strong circumpolar westerlies 
in the mid-latitudes, and weak easterlies along the coast.  The easterlies 
are strengthened by cold airflow (katabatic winds) down from the continental 
plateaus (Weller 1969).  These winds can exceed 70 kn for periods of hours. 
Mean surface air temperatures at the proposed drill sites seldom exceed 
0° C, and usually range from -15° to 0° C (Zwally et al. 1983).

General Circulation--

Circulation in the Southern Ocean (Figure 14) is dominated by the 
Antarctic circumpolar current (Gordon et al. 1978), driven by the strong 
westerlies in the vicinity of 60° S latitude (Wearn and Baker 1980).  Easterly 
winds nearshore drive a coastal current in the opposite direction.  The 
Antarctic Divergence shown in Figure 14 is an area of intense upwelling 
of deep water.  On rising to the surface, this water is cooled by the atmosphere 
and diluted by precipitation and melting ice.  It flows north and is subse-
quently mixed at the Polar Front, or Antarctic Convergence.  This denser 
water then sinks and flows north below the warmer surface layer.  This 
process is important in reoxygenating subsurface water of the world oceans.

Circulation in the Weddell Sea is made more complex by an elongated 
cyclonic gyre extending from the Antarctic Peninsula to 25-30° E longitude 
(Figure 15) (Carmack and Foster 1975; Foster and Carmack 1976; Gordon et 
al.

al. 1978; Deacon 1979; Gordon and Molinelli 1982).  Evidence suggests that 
the entire water mass of the Weddell Sea has a slow clockwise motion (Deacon 
1937).  Speeds increase with distance from the center, up to mean speeds 
on the order of 4 cm/sec (0.13 ft/sec) (Carmack and Foster 1975).  Tidal 
currents appear to be about half that speed.

Upwelling appears to occur throughout the interior of the gyre and 
recent measurements indicate a flushing time of 10 years or less (Weiss 
and Bullister 1984).  Carmack and Foster (1975) suggest that 69 percent 
of the outflow from the Weddell Sea is associated with the bottom layer 
and that less than 5 percent is in the near-surface layer.  Recent measurements 
indicate bottom water formed in the western portion of the Weddell Sea 
may escape in as little as 2 years (Foster and Carmack 1976).

The density structure of the Weddell Sea is unusual when compared 
with mid-latitude or tropical oceans.  The surface layer is thin [about 
100 m (328 ft)].  Throughout most of the water column, temperature and 
salinity profiles largely compensate each other, resulting in a thick, 
low-stability layer.  The bottom is a colder, slightly less saline, stable 
layer associated with Antarctic Bottom Water (see Figure 14).  This layer 
is often a few tens of meters thick (Foster and Middleton 1979).

Antarctic Bottom Water--

As the principal source region for Antarctic Bottom Water, the Weddell 
Sea has a significant effect on the circulation and abyssal properties 
of the world oceans.  Antarctic Bottom Water is produced during the formation 
of sea ice (i.e., in the austral winter when freezing processes are most 
active), primarily in the southwest corner of the Weddell Sea (Brennecke 
1921; Mosby 1934; Gordon 1971).  Ice formation causes an increase in salinity 
and a decrease in temperature of the surface water on the continental shelf. 
When a sufficiently high salinity is attained, this water sinks, flows 
off the shelf, and moves down the continental slope.  As it sinks, it mixes 
with warmer, more saline, deep water to form a water mass denser than either 
of its components.  Bottom water from the Weddell Sea can reach 400-450 N 
latitude in the western Atlantic Ocean (Wust 1936), and can strongly influence 
bottom circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (Reid and Lynn 1971). 
The direction of mean flow is consistent with the general clockwise circulation 
of the bottom currents in the western Weddell Sea noted in Figure 16.

Ice--

Ice constitutes a major navigational hazard in the Southern Ocean. 
Most icebergs in the Southern Ocean originate from the Filchner Ice Shelf 
in the Weddell Sea and from the Ross Ice Shelf in the Ross Sea.  Presumably, 
large year-to-year changes in ice cover are caused by ocean currents or 
by variations in atmospheric circulation and surface winds.  During austral 
winter, the ice pack may stretch 1,400-1,600 km (870-994 mi) from the Antarctic 
coast to the Atlantic Ocean, covering the area of the very cold surface 
current flowing from the Weddell Sea.  In later austral summer, the pack 
ice melts and begins to break up.  The ice edge gradually retreats toward 
the continent, reaching its southernmost limit in February or March.

Average ice concentrations for January and February (when the drill 
ship is expected to operate in the Weddell Sea) are shown in Figure 17 
for 1973-1976.  Since the ship cannot drill in any ice floe condition, 
the western portion of the Weddell Sea is not accessible even during the 
austral summer.

Geological and Geophysical Conditions--

The Weddell Sea is a deep oceanic basin on the Antarctic lithospheric 
plate. Geologically, this basin separates the East Antarctic craton from 
the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a post-Paleozoic orogenic belt (Barker 
and Jahn 1980; LaBrecque and Barker 1981).  The heavy ice coverage has 
allowed only limited geophysical coverage and the structure of the basin 
is poorly known, particularly in the west.  The northern part of the basin 
shows substantial basement relief, which is attributed to several closely 
spaced, small-offset fracture zones trending northwest to west-northwest. 
This fracture zone topography increases to the north (Barker and Jahn 1980).

Surface sediment data in the area are very sparse, consisting largely 
of a series of piston cores briefly described by Graves et al. (1982). 
In the northeast, sediments are composed of pelagic clays and muds.  In 
the northern part of the basin, surface sediments are composed of pelagic 
clay overlain by ash-bearing diatomaceous ooze. Sediments in the western 
abyssal plain are composed of pelagic clay, with minor amounts of sand 
and silt.  In the easternmost part of the basin, the ubiquitous Quaternary 
pelagic clay is interbedded with silt and mud.  The sedimentary strata 
in the Weddell abyssal plain proper are mostly barren of microfossils, 
making age determinations very difficult.  Sediment thickness in the region 
varies from approximately 1,000 m (3,281 ft) in the center of the basin 
to less than 400 m (1,312 ft) near the Maud Rise to the east and the Caird 
Margin in the south.

Limited geophysical coverage of the area has made age determinations 
of the basement rocks somewhat difficult.  Apparently the Weddell Basin 
is pre-late Jurassic to Cretaceous in age.  The basement is oldest at the 
southern portion of the basin and becomes progressively younger to the 
north.  Compilation of available magnetic profiles in the area by LaBrecque 
and Barker (1981) seems to indicate that the basement crust underlying 
the Weddell Sea is oceanic crust, formed at an east-west trending spreading 
center, with an age range of 35 to 162 million years.  This model yields 
spreading rates of 0.6 to 0.9 cm/year (0.24-0.35 in/year).  The magnetic 
anomalies display a strong east-west trend and seem to converge to the 
west (Bregman and Frakes 1970; Barker and Jahn 1980; LaBrecque and Barker 
1981).

Acoustical Environment--

Ambient noise in the ocean has been summarized by Wenz (1962) and 
Urick (1983).  The main components that contribute to noise in the ocean 
are shown in Figure 18.  Thermal noise due to molecular agitation contributes 
to the higher frequencies (greater than 20 kHz).  There are two components 
of hydrodynamic noise from spray, rain, bubbles, waves, and turbulence: 
a higher-frequency component (100-1,000 Hz) that is highly correlated to 
wind strength and a wind-independent, lower-frequency component (10-200 Hz).

Both near and distant ocean traffic can contribute to ambient noise, depending 
on transmission properties of the water masses.  Seismic sources (e.g., 
undersea earthquakes, slides, and slumps) contribute to lower frequency 
noise (1-100 Hz). Biological sources contribute a wide range of frequencies 
(10 to over 10 kHz), usually in short repetitive bursts.  Variability is 
the dominant feature of ambient ocean noise and an individual site cannot 
be characterized by a single specific background signature.

Sea ice affects ambient noise levels through mechanical noise from 
ice motion and other poorly defined means.  Noise levels are highly variable 
and uncorrelated to wind (Milne et al. 1967).  Pan ice produces median 
noise levels of 70 dB at 10 Hz (Verall 1981). Noise levels peak at the 
ice edge, where they average 86 dB at 100 Hz due to the interaction between 
waves and ice (Diachok 1980).  Shore fast ice produces noise from thermal 
stress cracking and from pressure ridges.  Mean values of 133 dB at 5-200 Hz 
have been reported (Buck and Greene 1979).

Georges Bank

    Georges Bank, part of the outer continental shelf between Massachusetts 
and Nova Scotia, is approximately 300 km (186 mi) long and 150 km (93 mi) 
wide.  It is separated from Nantucket Shoals by the shallow [depth of 70 m 
(230 ft)] Great South Channel (Figure 19).  Seaward of the 70-m (230 ft) 
isobath, the Georges Bank shelf is continuous with the New England shelf 
to the west.  To the northeast, Georges Bank is separated from the Scotian 
shelf by the deep [depth of 220 m (722 ft)] Northeast Channel, which cuts 
across the outer shelf to the shelf break.  The crest of the bank [shallower 
than 60 m (197 ft)] is shaped into a series of northwest-trending ridges. 
The tops of some of these ridges are less than 5 m (16 ft) below the sea 
surface.

Meteorology--

    Westerly and northwesterly winds prevail in the Georges Bank region 
from October through March.  During these months, mean wind speeds are 
7-12 kn, with the highest speeds often in the easternmost regions of the 
area.  Southwesterly winds with speeds of 3-6 kn occur in June, July, and 
August.  Summer wind speeds also peak in the eastern reaches of the Georges 
Bank region (Godshall et al. 1980).

    Storms of both tropical and extratropical origin pass through the 
area.  Tropical storms originate over the warm waters of the Caribbean, 
Gulf of Mexico, or the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. 
Tropical cyclones (wind speeds 34-63 kn) and hurricanes (wind speeds greater 
than 63 kn) move into the area along the east coast or offshore during 
late summer and autumn (Godshall et al. 1980). These storms are usually 
less intense in the North Atlantic, than they were in the southern latitudes. 
Extratropical storms are extensive (600-1,500 nmi), low-pressure systems 
that enter the area from either the west or the southwest.  Those moving 
through the area from the southwest can be particularly severe in terms 
of precipitation and winds.  The frequency of storm winds greater than 
34 kn at Georges Shoals is indicated in Table 7.

Visibility, commonly defined as the maximum distance at which a prominent 
object can be seen against the background, can be restricted by precipitation, 
fog, and spray.  Visibility is restricted to less than 2.0 nmi 15 percent 
of the time in May, 18 percent in June, and 16 percent in July.  Visibility 
is restricted to less than 0.5 nmi most often during May (12 percent), 
June (13 percent), and July (11 percent).

General Circulation--

Mean circulation in the Gulf of Maine is counterclockwise and circulation 
around Georges Bank is clockwise at speeds of 5-10 cm/sec  (0.16-0.33 ft/sec) 
(Figure 20) (Bigelow 1927; Bumpus and Lauzier 1965; Bumpus 1973, 1976). 
Westward and northward flow into the Gulf of Maine south of Nova Scotia 
and southwestward flow out of the Gulf of Maine across Nantucket Shoals 
have been observed in all seasons.  Clockwise circulation around Georges 
Bank is strongest in spring.  In summer, the surface circulation in the 
Gulf of Maine weakens and surface flow at the eastern end of Georges Bank 
is slightly offshore.  In winter, the near-surface flow is primarily wind-
driven, offshore, and southerly across Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine, 
with continued, although reduced, westerly drift along the shelf and across 
the Great South Channel.  Deeper mean flow along the shelf does not exhibit 
seasonal trends but has a larger offshore component than does the near-
surface flow (EG&G 1979, 1980).  Seasonal variation in mean current speeds 
on the shelf at Georges Bank is greater during the summer, with maximum 
mean flow decreasing with depth.  Mean flow along the shelf in winter is 
uniform with depth.

Butman et al. (1982) conducted detailed current measurements that 
verified the clockwise circulation around Georges Bank described above. 
A fast [30 cm/sec (1.15 ft/sec)], jet-like current was found along the 
northern slope of the bank.  The current enters the Gulf of Maine through 
the eastern side of the Great South Channel, flows along the northern slope, 
then passes through the Northeast Channel back out onto the shelf.  The 
same water mass may transit the bank more than once.  Some of the inflow 
through the Great South Channel may enter the counterclockwise gyre farther 
north in the Gulf of Maine.

Residence times of water masses for the entire Georges Bank increase 
gradually from a minimum in the winter to a maximum in the fall.  Mean 
residence time within the bank is 54 days (EG&G 1982).  However, depending 
on the site of release, some drifters used to determine residence times 
moved directly off the bank, while others completed more than one revolution 
around it (EG&G 1982).

Waters at depths shallower than 60 m (197 ft) are vertically well-
mixed year-round by strong semidiurnal tidal currents (Bumpus 1976).  Frontal 
zones separate these waters from those in the Gulf of Maine to the north 
and from those in the slope to the south (Butman et al. 1982).  During 
winter, the northern front is weaker and deeper than the southern front. 
This northern front can be seen in salinity and density profiles in water 
shallower than 100 m (328 ft) (Butman et al. 1982).  During winter, the 
southern front is sharply defined by strong temperature and salinity gradients 
that intersect the bottom at approximately the 80-m (262-ft) depth contour 
and separate the cooler, fresher shelf water from the warmer, saltier slope

water. These frontal zones may inhibit but do not preclude inflow and outflow onto the 60-m (197-ft) isobath environment. Most of the water on Georges Bank may be contributed by a southerly component of the eastward-flowing, jet-like current on the northern flank (EG&G 1982).  This may account for the high primary productivity of the shallow central area (EG&G 1982).

Tidal Currents--

Semidiurnal tidal currents associated with the Gulf of Maine-Bay of Fundy system are amplified over the relatively shallow depths of Georges Bank, leading to enhanced energy dissipation, vertical mixing, and secondary flows on Georges Bank (Brown 1984). Strong, rotary, semidiurnal tidal currents are a major feature of the Georges Bank area within the 60-m (197 ft) depth contour, where speeds of 76 cm/sec (2.9 ft/sec) have been recorded (Moody and Butman 1980). The western boundary of the Georges Bank, the Great South Channel, is also subject to strong tidal currents, where speeds as high as those within the 60-m (197-ft) isobath have been observed. Tidal currents are strong enough to vertically mix both these areas and Nantucket Shoals to the southwest (Garrett et al. 1978).  Deeper water is less responsive to tidal influence. On the south flank of Georges Bank, recorded tidal current speeds are almost half those observed in the shallow area of the bank [e.g., 40 cm/sec (1.5 ft/sec) in the southern flank and less than 5 cm/sec (0.19 ft/sec) south of Cape Cod (Moody and Butman 1980)]. Tidal currents and storms may winnow fine sediments from the crest of Georges Bank. Mean flow along the shelf carries them westward and deposits them south of Cape Cod, where the tidal currents decrease sufficiently to allow settling (Bothner et al. 1981).

Geological and Geophysical Conditions--

Georges Bank is a large [67,000 km2 (25,900 mi2)], submerged platform on the eastward continuation of the continental shelf southeast of New England. The Georges Bank Basin is a broad trough of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks that underlies the general platform and adjacent areas. It includes Georges Bank, the Great South Channel, Nantucket Shoals, and part of the continental slope. The southern edge of Georges Bank (slope of approximately 6 degrees) is heavily incised by submarine canyons and gulleys, which were probably eroded during the Quaternary and late Tertiary glacial stages.  East of the continental slope, the New England Seamount Chain, extends as linear feature for over 1,000 km (621 mi). Comprehensive reports have been published on the area (e.g., Schlee et al. 1975; Schlee 1981) and on two deep test wells in the area [Continental Offshore Stratigraphic Test (COST) Wells G-1 and G-2, Amato and Bebout 1980; Amato and Simonis 1980.] Physiography of Georges Bank Basin is discussed at length by Uchupi (1968), Schlee (1973), and Schlee and Klitgord (1981). Physiography of the adjacent seamount chain is discussed by Emery and Uchupi (1972).

Surficial sediments of Georges Bank consist of medium- to coarse-grained sand with small amounts of gravel. Current winnowing due to strong tidal flow has produced areas of coarse gravel in deeper waters around local shoals and areas of coarse- to medium-grained sand on the flanks of the ridges (Stewart and Jordan 1964; Stanley 1969; Schlee and Pratt 1970; Milliman et al. 1972; Trumball 1972; Schlee 1973). The southern two-thirds of the 
69
bank is a relatively flat shelf covered with rippled sand. The northern
section of the bank is covered by a series of north and south trending
sand ridges. Composition of the sand remains constant over much of the
bank (Milliman et al. 1972), with median grain size decreasing to the south
of Nantucket Shoals and along the southern edge of the bank (Schlee and
Pratt 1970).

Subsurface structure, age, and lithology of the rocks underlying the
surface sediments are summarized in Figure 21. Early rifting during the
Triassic between North America and Africa was followed by the initiation
of seafloor spreading in the early Jurassic. During rifting, large volumes
of sediments were deposited on the new oceanic crust seaward of the boundary
between rifted continental crust and oceanic crust. During late rifting
or early seafloor spreading, evaporation resulted in the deposition of
salt that subsequently formed diapir structures. Drilling results and
deep geophysical profiling data indicate that the Georges Bank Basin had
rapid sediment accumulation during the Jurassic, with much diminished accumu-
lation thereafter (Schlee and Klitgord 1981). Upper sediment layers consist
of eroded Tertiary coastal plain sediments followed by deposition of an
extensive wedge of Pleistocene sediments (Lewis et al. 1980). Paleo-history
of the area is summarized by Grow (1981) and Schlee and Klitgord (1981).

Detailed seismic studies indicate that the core of Georges Bank is
a wedge of Triassic and younger sediments that overlies the rifted basement
(Figure 21). Multi-channel, seismic-reflection profiles of the continental
shelf, slope, and rise by the U.S. Geological Survey and the German Geological
Survey between 1973 and 1979 defined the structure of the sedimentary fill
along this portion of the Atlantic margin. The fill is approximately 16 km
(10 mi) thick in the center of the basin, with up to 9 km (6 mi) of sediment
beneath the continental rise. The sediment cover thins to an average of
3-4 km (2-2.5 mi) at the eastward edge of the area in the deep ocean basin
(Schlee 1981).

The East Coast Magnetic Anomaly (ECMA) (Figure 22) defines the boundary
zone between oceanic crust and the main part of Georges Bank Basin. Seaward
of the ECMA, the low magnetic relief of the Jurassic Quiet Zone grades
into the normal relief of lineated oceanic crust. Landward of the ECMA,
a series of magnetic anomalies associated with basement grabens is superimposd
on the general variations associated with the relatively deep crystalline
basement of the basin. The large fracture zones associated with Mid-Atlantic
spreading are also shown in Figure 22. For the most part, these transform
faults do not extend into the Georges Bank Basin.

Acoustical Environment--

Ambient noise levels are characterized by large variability due to
numerous components, as discussed in detail under the Weddell Sea acoustic
environment.

the East Pacific Rise and one along the Mid-American Trench, are located
within this region (Figure 23). The East Pacific Rise, an active spreading
center, transects the ocean floor of this region (Figure 23). The Galapagos
Spreading Center, a shorter series of ridges and transform faults, runs
from the East Pacific Rise east to the northern end of South America.
The oceanic crust generated from these rifting systems is subducted under
the continents along Central and South America. The coast is characterized
by a narrow continental shelf and a steep slope dropping into deep trenches.
The system of ridges along the rifting axes creates a series of deep basins
[3,500-4,500 m (11,480-14,760 ft)] throughout this part of the Pacific
Ocean.

Meteorology--

The meteorology in the eastern tropical Pacific is dominated by the
trade winds. The northeast trade winds are strongest from December through
April, with maximum velocities occuring near 100 N latitude (Figure 24).
The southeast trade winds reach their maximum in both velocity and northern
extent from July to October. During this period, the northeast trades
virtually disappear east of 1200 W longitude and westerlies can develop
around 100 N latitude. The trade winds converge at the Inter-Tropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ), an area of weak and variable winds. Depending
on the strength of the trade winds, the mean position of the ITCZ in the
region east of 1200 W longitude oscillates from 150 N latitude in September
to about 20 N latitude in March. Along the coast, the wind patterns are
much more complex due to surface heating and cooling and to topographical
barriers. During the northern hemisphere winter, airflow is generally
equatorward along the coast. During the northern hemisphere summer, airflow
along Central America can be poleward.

General Circulation--

The surface circulation in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean varies
considerably in response to the shifting of the major wind systems. Beneath
the trade winds are the westward-flowing equatorial currents, which are
part of the main anticyclonic current gyres of the north and south Pacific
Ocean. The North Equatorial Current and the California Current are part
of the gyre in the north Pacific Ocean, while the South Equatorial Current
and Peru Current are part of the gyre in the south Pacific Ocean (Figure 25).
The Equatorial Countercurrent runs between the two gyres when the ITCZ
is sufficiently north of the equator. Because the gyres do not reach into
the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean between Cape Corrientes in Mexico and
Ecuador, this area has a variable and complicated circulation.

Three typical circulation patterns may be defined for the eastern
tropical Pacific Ocean (Wyrtki 1966). The first pattern occurs from August
to December (Figure 25), when the Equatorial Countercurrent is fully developed
and the ITCZ coincides with its northern boundary at or north of 100 N
latitude. During this time, most water of the countercurrent flows around
the Costa Rica Dome (near 90 N latitude and 890 W longitude), into the
Costa Rica Coastal Current, and on into the North Equatorial Current between
100 and 200 N latitude. This is the dominant and most stable circulation
pattern.

The second circulation pattern occurs from February to Apri1, when 
the ITCZ reaches its most southerly position near 20 N latitude.  During 
this period, the California Current is strong, penetrates far to the south, 
and supplies most of the water for the North Equatorial Current.  Off the 
coast of Mexico between 100 and 200 N latitude, the circulation is anti-
cyclonic.  Flow is to the southeast along the coast and turns westward 
off the Gulf of Tehuantepec (Figure 25).  The countercurrent is weak or 
absent during this period and water flows west and northwest where the 
countercurrent would otherwise be found (Tsuchiya 1974; Hayes et al. 1982). 
Two large eddies develop off the coast of Central America: one is cyclonic 
around the Costa Rica Dome, the other is anticyclonic around a point at 
50 N latitude, 880 W longitude.  The South Equatorial Current is weak and 
currents to the east are occasionally reported near the equator.

The third typical circulation pattern occurs from May to July, when 
the Equatorial Countercurrent forms again, but the California Current is 
still relatively strong.  During this period the ITCZ is again near 100 N 
latitude (which allows the countercurrent to develop).  Most of the water 
from the countercurrent turns north into the Costa Rica Coastal Current 
during this period and flows along the coast of Central America as far 
as Cape Corrientes.  The California Current is still strong and reaches 
far to the south, but does not significantly penetrate into the eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean.

Equatorial undercurrents also affect circulation.  These currents 
flow from west to east, are about 300 m (984 ft) thick, reach 400 km (249 mi) 
in width, and can be traced from 900 W longitude to as far west as 1500-1600 W 
longitude (Knauss 1963).  Their highest speed (up to 3 kn) is centered 
in the thermocline at depths of 50-150 m (164-492 ft), shallowing to the 
east.  These subsurface countercurrents, nearly symetrical about the equator, 
are usually identified with the North Equatorial Current in the northern 
hemisphere and with the South Equatorial Current in the southern hemisphere 
(White 1971).  The southern equatorial undercurrent weakens as it approaches 
the Galapagos Islands, from peak velocities of about 120 cm/sec (4.6 ft/sec) 
near the equator at 1100 W longitude to less than 10 cm/sec (0.38 ft/sec) 
at 850 W longitude (Leetmaa 1982).  Evidence for additional eastward-flowing 
subsurface countercurrents in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Tsuchiya 
1975; Hayes et al. 1982) suggests that the region's flow field is dynamic 
and may consist of numerous ribbons.

An important feature of surface circulation is E1 Niño.  Through forcing 
of the equatorial currents by the trade winds, water piles up in the western 
Pacific Ocean.  When the trade winds diminish, upwelling on the eastern 
boundary weakens.  The water piled up in the west sloshes back at depth 
with the countercurrents, replacing the nutrient-rich water along the eastern 
boundary with warm, saline, nutrient-poor water.  A mild E1 Niño typically 
occurs each year around Christmas.  However, sometimes the whole process 
is magnified.  Warm water reaches far north and south, pushing the California 
and Peru currents far offshore and transforming the circulation pattern 
in the eastern tropical Pacific.

77
Bottom Water Circulation--

Throughout the Pacific Basin west of the East Pacific Rise, there is 
general eastward transport of bottom water.  The water passes through 
the rise at the deeper passages, usually along transform faults, into the 
Guatemala and Peru Basins (Figure 26).  Different bottom water is supplied 
to the Peru and Panama Basins by northward flow along the Peru-Chile trench.
Flow is generally slow, with little evidence of substantial bottom currents.
However, average speeds of 33 cm/sec (1.3 ft/sec) have been reported at 
the sill into the Panama Basin (Lonsdale 1976).  Flow patterns in the 
Mid-America Trench have not been well-studied.

Residual tidal currents with no net transport and speeds of 10-20 cm/sec 
(0.38-0.76 ft/sec) have been measured across the East Pacific Rise.  This 
creates a mixing zone in which the bottom water is modified by the addition 
of deep water and metalliferous particulates from active spreading center 
processes (Lonsdale 1977a).  Geothermal heating from these spreading centers 
also alters circulation. The heated plume from hydrothermal vents entrains 
water as it rises until the water reaches neutral buoyancy 200-500 m (656-
1,640 ft) higher in the water column.  Replacement of the entrained water 
produces local bottom flow toward the vents.  This plume may drive a circulation 
at the level of neutral buoyancy that reaches hundreds of kilometers west 
of the ridge (Stommel 1982).

Oxygen Minimum Zone--

Eastern tropical Pacific waters are characterized by a warm surface 
layer and a sharp, permanent thermocline (a layer that separates the warmer 
upper layer from the underlying cold water). The thermocline inhibits 
mixing between the upper layer, which is high in dissolved oxygen and low 
in nutrients, and deeper waters, which are low in oxygen and relatively 
high in nutrients.  Minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., <0.25 ml/l) 
are found immediately below the thermocline and extend from depths of 100 
to nearly 1,000 m (328 to nearly 3,280 ft).  This oxygen minimum layer 
is caused by the biochemical process of oxygen consumption and its distribution 
is determined by circulation (Wyrtki 1962).  It is thickest and closest 
to the surface north of about 10°N latitude (Wooster and Cromwell 1958).

Geological and Geophysical Conditions--

Mid-American Trench--The Mid-American Trench typifies an oceanic trench 
in a collision zone between oceanic (i.e., Cocos) and continental (i.e., 
Caribbean) plates.  This zone also includes a deep seismically active (Benioff 
zone reflecting oceanic plate subduction, and a Quaternary volcanic chain.
Recent investigations have shown that the subduction zone is both currently 
active and segmented (e.g., different tectonic fabrics found along the 
subducting margin) (Dengo 1983).

The Mid-American Trench has been studied intensely in order to understand 
the fundamental geological processes associated with subduction.  In theory 
the overriding continental plate is envisioned as scraping rock and sediment 
from the surface of the downgoing oceanic plate.  This off-scraped sediment 
and rock are then "plated" against the face of the overriding plate to 
form an "accretionary prism".  Although there are a number of variations

on this theme, the model has gained general acceptance in the literature 
(Silver 1971; Grow 1973; Beck and Lehner 1974; Seely et al. 1974; Karig 
and Sharman 1975; Montecchi 1976; Coulbourn and Moberly 1977; Hamilton 
1977; Ladd et al. 1978; Ladd and Watkins 1979; Le Quellec et al. 1980; 
Shipley et al. 1980). Some investigators argue that most of the incoming 
pelagic sediment and basalt are subducted. This is accompanied by tectonic 
erosion of some of the overriding plate (Scholl and Marlow 1974; Hussong 
et al. 1976; Scholl et al. 1977; Hussong and Uyeda 1981; Hussong and Wipperman 
1981).

Several DSDP sites on the Mid-American Trench were drilled in an effort 
to answer some of these fundamental questions about subduction. DSDP Leg 
66 drilled a transect of holes perpendicular to the subduction front off 
the coast of Mexico (Watkins, Moore et al. 1981). Results indicate that 
subduction has been active in this region for the last 10 million years 
and that the sediment input into the subduction zone is partitioned, with 
roughly equal amounts being off scraped, underplated, and subducted. The 
offscraped component appears to consist primarily of trench turbidites, 
with the subducted component primarily pelagic-hemipelagic sediments (Watkins, 
Moore et al. 1981). Major geological features associated with classic 
subduction along the Mid-American Trench at the Leg 66 drill sites are 
shown in Figure 27.

DSDP Leg 67 involved drilling a similar transect off the Guatemala 
portion of the Mid-American Trench and produced strikingly different results. 
In a hole 3 km (1.9 mi) landward of the trench, Leg 67 penetrated a Cretaceous 
to Pleistocene claystone and hemipelagic sequence before bottoming in igneous 
rocks atypical of ocean basalts. These results are inconsistent with that 
expected from an "accretionary prism" (Aubouin, von Huene et al. 1982). 
Gas hydrate (clathrate) compounds were recovered on both Legs 66 and 67 
(Watkins, Moore et al. 1981; Harrison and Curiale 1981).

Off the Costa Rica section of the Mid-American Trench, the slope is 
composed of a deeper, apparently accretionary sequence beneath a thick 
slope apron. During DSDP Leg 84, one drill site (Site 565) was attempted 
to test the various models of accretionary zone formation, and this hole 
penetrated 328 m (1,078 ft) of mudstones of early Miocene and Quaternary 
age before being abandoned (Aubouin et al. 1984; Shipley and Moore in press). 
Gas hydrates were also recovered in this hole in the slope apron at a depth 
of 3,100 m (10,170 ft) below sea level.

Gas hydrates appear to present a major obstacle to drilling along 
the Mid-American Trench, with all three DSDP legs encountering them (Collins 
and Watkins 1985). One possible method to allow deep penetration into 
the accretionary prism is to use high-resolution seismic survey techniques 
to find areas where the characteristic seismic signature of clathrates 
does not exit (Shipley and Moore in press). Problems associated with drilling 
in clathrate zones are discussed in Chapter 4.

East Pacific Rise--Although there are some notable exceptions, the 
axes of mid-ocean ridges are generally characterized by broad central rift 
valleys for slow spreading rates and by axial highs for fast spreading 
rates. The East Pacific Rise (EPR) near 13° N latitude, which is opening 
at a fast rate of 11-13 cm/year (4.3-5.1 in/year), consists of a large

bathymetric ridge, rising approximately 200-400 m (656-1,312 ft) above 
the surrounding terraine.  The ridge is 2-10 km (1.2-6.2 mi) wide.  Along-
strike, the EPR can be characterized as a string of these bathymetric ridges, 
now recognized as individual spreading center "segments" each 25-150 km 
(16-93 mi) long (Figure 28) (Ballard and Francheteau 1982; Francheteau 
and Ballard 1983; Macdonald and Sempere 1984).  The summit of the bathymetric 
ridge is characterized by recent glassy lava flows and a complete lack 
of sediment cover. In this neovolcanic zone, volcanic processes are responsible 
for most of the topographic relief. Recent discoveries indicate that adjacent 
ridge segments can have overlapping spreading centers (OSCs).  These OSCs 
can range in scale from 3 to 30 km (2 to 19 mi) and are very common on 
medium- and fast-spreading ridges (Lonsdale 1977b; Johnson et al. 1983; 
Macdonald and Sempere 1984).  These OSCs are quite common along the ridge 
axis at 130 N latitude (Figure 28), with the shortest known ridge segment 
[25 km (16 mi)] isolated by OSCs at 120 37' N latitude and 120 54' N latitude.

The center of each ridge segment is the shoalest portion of that segment. 
The OSCs and zones of transform faulting are several hundreds of meters 
deeper than the ridge centers.  This phenomenon is quite common along the 
EPR and has also observed at the Galapagos Rift, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 
and the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  Several other along-strike gradients have 
been observed within given ridge segments.  First, the abundance of sheet 
flows seems to increase toward the central high, with pillow basalts more 
common at the lower distal ends.  Second, the degree and density of fracturing 
seems to be less as the central high is approached.  Finally, the abundance 
of hydrothermal venting seems to increase toward the central high.

Since their discovery at the Galapagos Rift in 1977, hydrothermal 
vents have been shown to be a common feature of medium- to fast-spreading 
centers (Corliss et al. 1979; Ballard and Francheteau 1982; Francheteau 
and Ballard 1983).  Active hydrothermal systems can have water temperatures 
in excess of 3500 C and pH values close to 2.  Hydrothermal alteration 
of the lower crustal layers in ophiolites and that observed below 600 m 
(1,968 ft) in DSDP Hole 504b clearly indicate that hydrothermal alteration 
is a major crustal formation process.  As such, it is likely to be a major 
focus of any near-axis drilling of the EPR near 130 N latitude.

The French conducted an intensive survey of the EPR, using SEABEAM, 
followed up by submersible and deep tow camera surveys in the area near 
130 N latitude.  In 1982, a French expedition utilizing the submersible 
CYANA was conducted in the area of the axis at 120 49' N latitude.  Here, 
a series of high-temperature "black smoker" vent sites were located over 
a distance of 8 km (5 mi), and sulfide deposits on either end of this active 
zone were mapped for a total linear distance of 17 km (11 mi) (Ballard 
and Francheteau 1982).  Individual vent deposits were 10-50 m (33-164 ft) 
in diameter, with 100-200 m (328-656 ft) between deposits.  Subsequent 
dives in the area also located enormous massive sulfide deposits on the 
western flank of a seamount to the east.

These observations have led to a number of speculations about subcrustal 
structure near a spreading axis.  Geochemical arguments almost certainly 
require a relatively shallow crustal magma chamber lying between 1 and 
3 km (0.6 and 1.8 mi) depth.  The shoaling of each individual ridge segment 
at the center has led several authors to argue that a permanent magma chamber

underlies the central portion of the ridge segment and that there are only 
occasional magma excursions to the distal ends of the segments.  Such a 
model is consistent with the observed hydrothermal activity at the shoalest 
portions of the segments and with all the other geological features.

Acoustical Environment--
 
Ambient noise levels are characterized by large variability due to 
numerous components, as discussed in detail under the Weddell Sea acoustic 
environment.

BIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE DRILLING AREAS

Weddell Sea

Phytoplankton--

  Two phytoplankton communities have been documented in the Southern 
Ocean.  One (pelagic) inhabits the water column and the other (epontic) 
inhabits the intersticies of sea ice.  Both contribute to the extremely 
high primary production of the antarctic marine ecosystem, including the 
Weddell Sea.

  The water-column phytoplankton community is dominated by diatoms, 
about 100 species of which are found in antarctic and subantarctic marine 
waters (Bal ech et al. 1968). Dinoflagellates are second in importance 
in antarctic waters. Other phytoplankters in antarctic waters and the 
Weddell Sea include silicoflagellates, naked flagellates, and radiolarians 
(Balech et al. 1968; El-Sayed and Turner 1977; Nelson and Gordon 1982). 
However, they have not been studied extensively because they are difficult 
to collect.

  Photosynthetic activity in the water column is highest in the austral 
spring and summer. Whereas average yearly production for the Weddell Sea 
is estimated at 84 g C/m^(2) (El-Sayed and Mandelli 1965), average primary 
productivity in the Weddell Sea during the austral spring is estimated 
at 220-420 mgC·m^(-2)·day^(-1) (Jennings et al. 1984). Dense phytoplankton blooms 
which often occur near the marginal ice zone contribute to the higher produc-
tivity values estimated for the spring and summer months (Smith and Nelson 
1985). Standing crops of phytoplankters in surface waters near the drilling 
area of 0-0.49 mgC/m^(3) and photosynthesis rates of 0-29.9 mg C·m^(-2)·h^(-1) have 
been measured (Balech et al. 1968). Similar standing crops and rates of 
photosynthesis were reported for stations in the drilling area that were 
sampled in the austral summer of 1977 (El-Sayed and Taguchi 1981). However, 
there is considerable regional and temporal variation (El-Sayed and Mandelli 
1965; El-Sayed and Taguchi 1981; Hayes et al. 1984; Smith and Nelson 1985). 
Dense phytoplankton blooms may occur near marginal ice zones (Smith and 
Nelson 1985). Chlorophyll a values and photosynthesis rates are closely 
correlated (r=0.97) (El-Sayed and Mandelli 1965).

  In contrast to other regions of the world ocean, nutrients necessary 
for primary production (i.e., nitrates, phosphates, silicates, trace metals, 
vitamins) are rarely, if ever, limiting in the antarctic (El-Sayed and 
Mandelli 1965; El-Sayed 1966; Hayes et al. 1984). For this reason, it 

84
is unlikely that nutrients caused the observed spatial and temporal variations.
Water column stability, grazing, and proximity to land masses are more
likely causes (El-Sayed and Taguchi 1981). Primary productivity is enhanced
in areas where the water in the euphotic zone is well-mixed and water below
the photic zone is stratified. Grazing by zooplankters (primarily krill
and copepods) appears to consume a substantial proportion of the phytoplankton
production. Finally, proximity to land masses appears to be correlated
with high primary production (El-Sayed and Taguchi 1981), but possible
causes of this relationship are unclear (Hayes et al. 1984).

The sea-ice phytoplankton community consists of the snow and epontic
communities. The snow community occurs when the weight of the snow on
the sea ice causes the ice surface to be depressed below the water surface.
Seawater and planktonic organisms flood the snow, and a biological community
15-100 cm (6-39 in) thick begins to develop in the slush. This layer may
be frozen during cold weather, although snow above the slush layer often
insulates it (Horner 1976). Diatoms are important components of the snow
community (Horner 1977). The average chlorophyll a concentration of the
snow layer is estimated at 97 mg/m2 (Horner 1977). Primary productivity
is estimated at 0.19 mg C·m-2·h-1.

The epontic community consists of 32 species of diatoms plus other
microorganisms that inhabit the undersurface of the ice or brine pockets
in the ice (Horner 1977). Most species of epontic diatoms are adapted
to light levels at the lower limit of the euphotic zone (e.g., less than
1 percent of surface light intensity).

Ice algae in the antarctic begin to multiply in the brash ice in July.
By December, they may reach densities greater than 106 cells/l. Areas
bare of snow tend to have the highest cell concentrations, while areas
of heavy snow have lower concentrations. Annual production is on the order
of 500-1,000 mg C/m2 during the peak growing season (Horner 1976). Bacteria
are also present in these epontic communities. It is hypothesized that
the microalgae stimulate bacterial growth (Grossi et al. 1984), and that
the bacteria are a source of secondary production (Sullivan and Palmisano
1984). Ice algae released from melting ice during the spring and summer
months may serve as an inoculum for phytoplankton blooms which occur in
the water column (Smith and Nelson 1985). Moreover, reduced surface salinity
may increase water column stability and thereby promote the bloom (Smith
and Nelson 1985).

The highest concentrations of epontic organisms in the Weddell Sea
are found at depths of 0.65-2.15 m (2.1-7.0 ft) within the ice (Ackley
et al. 1979) and are strongly associated with salinity maxima in the ice.
Chlorophyll a concentrations of 0.31-4.54 mg/m3 were found in the study
area (Ackley et al. 1979). Based on these data, Ackley et al. (1979) concluded
that standing crops of ice algae "can represent a minor but significant
fraction of the total standing crop of the region."

Epontic communities also occur in arctic regions, and many of the
mechanisms which are hypothesized to occur in antarctic regions are also
hypothesized to occur in the arctic. For example, spring phytoplankton
blooms often occur near ice melting edges where epontic diatoms may serve
as an innoculum (Schandelmeier and Alexander 1981). The melting ice also

85
appears to promote phytoplankton blooms in the marginal ice zone by reducing 
surface salinities and thereby increasing vertical stability in the water 
column (Alexander and Niebauer 1981; Niebauer et al. 1981).

Zooplankton--

    Although zooplankton are the major link between primary producers 
(i.e., phytoplankton) and higher trophic levels in all oceans, antarctic 
zooplankton are relatively more important than those in other ocean ecosystems. 
First, antarctic food chains are very short (e.g., baleen whales, crabeater 
seals, penguins, fish, and squid occupy only the third trophic level in 
Figure 29). Second, relatively more energy transfer between primary production 
and higher trophic levels occurs via zooplankton because ice scouring inhibits 
attached algae at shallow depths. Third, standing stocks of zooplankton 
in the antarctic are substantially greater than those in most temperate 
and tropical water [e.g., 55.2 mg/m3 for the upper 50 m (164 ft) and 25.6 
mg/m3 for the upper 1,000 m (3,280 ft) of water (Knox 1970)]. In addition, 
zooplankton growth is extremely intense, but temporally restricted due 
to the severe climate.

    Antarctic zooplankton may be divided into two groups based on size 
and mobility. One group, net plankton, includes small species that are 
readily captured in a towed net with a mesh size of 1.0 mm (0.04 in) or 
less. Net avoidance by these species is minimal. The other group includes 
large, motile species that readily avoid small plankton nets, but that 
may be captured in trawls. The principal component of this group is euphausid 
crustaceans, commonly known as krill. Nearly all zooplankters in antarctic 
waters are holoplankton, or permanent members of the plankton community. 
Meroplankton (plankters that are larval forms of nektonic or benthic species) 
are uncommon (see Arnaud 1977).

    Major components of the net zooplankton include copepods, chaetognaths, 
tintinnids, polychaete larvae, and ostracods (Hopkins 1971; Fukuchi and 
Tanimura 1981). Radiolarians, foraminiferans, medusae, siphonophores, 
amphipods, pteropods, echinoderm larvae, and appendicularians also occur, 
and may be locally or seasonally important. Although most net zooplankton 
occur in the upper 250 m (820 ft) of the water column, they are abundant 
as deep as 1,000 m (3,281 ft), the depth to which many species undergo 
annual vertical migrations (Hopkins 1971). Net zooplankton stocks are 
both spatially and temporally variable, with highest stocks generally occurring 
during the austral summer. Peak densities may exceed 4,000 individuals/m3 
(Fukuchi and Tanimura 1981).

    Euphausids, or krill, are the most important single component of the 
antarctic zooplankton community. They are a major prey item for higher 
trophic levels (Figure 29) and they are very abundant. Although spatially 
and temporally variable, krill may constitute up to 50 percent of the total 
zooplankton biomass (Knox 1970; Rakusa-Suszczewski 1983). Krill biomass 
is estimated at 30-50 mg/m3 for all antarctic waters (see Knox 1970; Everson 
1981a). However, such estimates are crude, due to the difficulties of 
sampling patchily distributed, motile organisms.

    Numerous euphausid species occur in antarctic waters. Each is distributed 
around the continent and each is associated with at least one water mass

REFERENCE: GREEN  1977
(Figure 30). Major krill concentrations occur in the northern and eastern portions of the Weddell Sea (Figure 31). Euphausia superba is the most abundant species and is therefore a key trophic link in the antarctic marine ecosystem. Its principal zone of distribution is between the continental shelf break and the mean extent of the pack ice.

Krill are often found in dense swarms 2-300 m (6-984 ft) long (Nemoto et al. 1981). Swarm densities have been estimated at 6-60 kg/m3, but such estimates incorporate large error factors (Everson 1981a). Food avail- ability, light intensity, turbulence, eddy currents, spawning, and hydrodynamic conditions have been suggested as causal mechanisms for the formation of krill swarms, but no cause has been demonstrated conclusively (see Everson 1981a; Rakusa-Suszczewski 1983).

Krill spawn from November through April, with peak spawning in February or March. Released eggs develop as they descend through the water column. Upon hatching (which may be at a depth of several thousand meters), the nauplii ascend through the water column and continue developing (see Everson 1981a). It has been suggested that discrete stocks of Euphausia superba are maintained in the Weddell Sea and other antarctic regions where gyres occur. However, data collected by several researchers to test this hypothesis are contradictory (see Schneppenheim and MacDonald 1984).

Nekton--

Cephalopods and fishes are the most prominent members of antarctic nekton. As primary level predators (which are, in turn, consumed by marine mammals and birds), both are important components of the food web (see Figure 29).

Very little is known of the cephalopods in antarctic waters (Roper 1981), except that pelagic squids constitute most of the cephalopod biomass in antarctic waters and benthic octopods contribute the balance. Both serve as important prey for sperm whales, seals, penguins, pelagic birds, and fishes (Roper 1981). At present, 18 antarctic cephalopod species are known (Roper 1981).

The antarctic fish fauna exhibit some unusual attributes. First, the number of species is relatively small, considering the size of the region. Only 120 antarctic species have been recorded (DeWitt 1971), 10 of which are strictly abyssal forms. Most species are circumpolar. Second, four families of the suborder Notothenioidei dominate the fauna: Nototheniidae, Harpagiferidae, Bathydraconidae, and Channichthyidae. Together, they constitute 79 of the reported 120 species (DeWitt 1971) and more than 90 percent of the individuals (Targett 1981). Most (95 percent) of these Notothenioid fishes are endemic to the antarctic. Third, despite the great abundance of krill in the water column, highly motile, schooling species (such as tunas) which could prey on krill are not present in antarctic waters (Everson 1981b). Only one species is entirely pelagic, and it is not a schooling species. Three other nototheniid species live in association with the underice surface (DeWitt 1971). The remaining Notothenioid fishes are primarily demersal forms (DeWitt 1971), many of which have no swim bladder (Everson 1981b). Lastly, species in the family Channichthyidae lack hemoglobin and functional erythrocytes (see Everson 1981b).

Two groups of antarctic fishes may be defined (DeWitt 1971):  deep-sea
species and coastal species.  The two faunas overlap on the outer continental
shelf and upper continental slope at depths of 500-700 m (1,600-2,300 ft)
around the continent proper, and at greater depths offshore the Antarctic
Peninsula.  Characteristic deep-sea fauna include members of the families
Synaphobrachidae (one species), Halosauridae (one species), Brotulidae
(one species), and Macrouridae (seven species).  The coastal fishes are
dominated by species in the suborder Notothenioidei, although species in
10 other families are also present.

Coastal antarctic fishes typically feed upon krill and benthic inverte-
brates (e.g., polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, echiurans, ophiuroids,
scaphopods, tunicates, shrimps, and mysids), although some species feed
on pelagic chaetognaths and calanoid copepods (see Targett 1981; Naito
and Iwami 1982; Takahashi 1983).  Food resources are highly partitioned
among the numerically abundant species of coastal fishes of South Georgia
Island, the South Sandwich Islands, and the South Orkney Islands.  However,
a given species does not always consume the same prey at different study
sites (Targett 1981).

Reliable estimates of species abundances for fishes in the Weddell
Sea are not available. However, SCOR Working Group 54 (1977) listed 12
species believed to be of major importance in the Southern Ocean, 10 of
which occur around the Antarctic continent.  Many species are small, as
evidenced by mean species lengths of less than 43 cm (17 in) for the noto-
thenioid families (Andriyashev 1965).

Benthos--

The distribution of marine benthic invertebrates in Antarctica is
generally considered to be circumpolar (see Knox and Lowry 1977).  However,
there are three major vertical zones of benthic fauna, as defined by the
distribution of substrate types and the presence of sea ice (see Dell 1972
for a review).

Zone I occurs at depths of 0-15 m (0-49 ft).  Intense ice scouring
occurs within this zone and only motile benthic invertebrates are common.
Representatives include echinoderms, nemerteans, snails, isopods, and a
few pycnogonids (sea spiders).  Typically these omnivorous and carnivorous
organisms are sparsely distributed.

The second zone occurs at depths of 15 to 33 m (49 to 108 ft).  The
bottom of the zone [33 m (108 ft)] is well-defined, since this is the lower
limit of anchor ice formation.  Anchor ice forms by in situ crystallization,
and may physically remove bottom biota when blocks become large enough
to break free of the substrate. Sessile forms are common in Zone II.
Dominant taxa include large hexactinellid sponges, demosponges, octocorals,
anemones, and ascidians.  The sponges, hydroids, and ascidians are suspension
feeders, while the anemones typically prey on medusae.  The motile organisms
found in Zone I are also common in Zone II.

The upper limit of Zone III is sharply defined at the lower limit
of anchor ice formation [33 m (108 ft) depth].  The lower limit is not
well-defined, but often extends to depths greater than 500 m (1,640 ft).

91
This community is characterized by a nearly complete mat of living sponges, 
sponge spicules, bivalve shells, hydroids, gorgonian corals, and bryozoans. 
The sponge mat is usually at least 1 m (3.3 ft) thick, and forms a habitat 
for many other sessile and motile organisms. Overall, sponges and other 
sessile suspension feeders form the basis of this community. Other organisms 
that commonly occur in association with the sponge mat include suspension-
feeding bivalve molluscs, gastropods, predatory and detritus-feeding asteroids, 
and predatory nudibranchs and snails.

Volcanic debris is sometimes encountered on the continental shelf 
within Zone III. This substrate supports a fauna of hexactinellid sponges 
and anthozoans. Associated with these sessile forms may be isopods, nemerteans, 
ophiuroids, asteroids, amphipods, mysids, cumaceans, tanaids, snails, and 
bivalve molluscs.

The suspension-feeding communities found at depths greater than 33 m 
(108 ft) may exhibit very high standing stocks. Biomass of a sponge-mat 
community off the East Antarctic Shelf is estimated to reach 1,347 g/m2 
at depths of 100-200 m (328-656 ft), 293 g/m2 at depths of 200-500 m (656-
1,640 ft), and 43 g/m2 at depths of 500-1,000 m (1,640-3,280 ft) (Belyaev 
and Uschakov 1957). These dense, diverse assemblages on the continental 
shelf and slope depend directly on organic particulates generated in the 
water column during the austral summer.

Two deep soft-bottom communities are often found in antarctic waters. 
The deep-shelf assemblage occurs in areas of mud or sandy mud; erratic 
boulders may be present. Common organisms include tubiculous polychaetes, 
sipunculid worms, foraminifera, ophiuroids, rat-tailed holothurians, pycno-
gonids, corals, scaphopod molluscs, and asteroids. The deep-slope community 
is found at depths of 1,200-2,200 m (3,936-7,216 ft) on diatomaceous ooze. 
Infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates are sparsely distributed in this habitat.

In addition to the major benthic communities described above, occasional 
shallow-water, soft-bottom communities occur in antarctic waters. Such 
communities have been documented at Arthur Harbor on the Antarctic Peninsula 
(Lowry 1975) and in Chile Bay on Deception Island (Gallardo et al. 1977). 
Based on the limited information available, it appears that faunal composition 
differs substantially among these habitats.

In addition to benthic macrofauna, benthic macroalgae have been collected 
at scattered antarctic locations where conditions permit macroalgal growth 
(Balech et al. 1968). Red and brown algae appear to dominate such communities 
(Balech et al. 1968). As in temperate and tropical latitudes, an epifaunal 
community is associated with the algal canopies (see Price and Redfearn 
1966). Polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans, nemerteans, and turbellarians 
are typically present among the macroalgae.

tration of pack ice or fast ice.  With the exception of leopard seals,
which occasionally prey on the others, these seal species are rarely seen
in the vicinity of each other.

A recent increase in reproductive rates for the crabeater seal, and
to a lesser extent, leopard and Ross seals has been attributed to increased
prey availability (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization 1978).  Stocks
of baleen whales depleted by whaling since the early 1900's has resulted
in reduced predation by whales on krill populations (Conroy 1975, Laws
1977b).  Release of this important prey resource from its major predator
appears to have resulted in greater availability of krill to other predators,
including seals and penguins.

Additional seal species residing in the antarctic include the southern
elephant seal (a phocid), and the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic fur seals
(otarids).  All three populations had been heavily exploited by humans
and are now recovering from near extinction.  Southern elephant seals breed
on islands throughout the South Scotia Sea.  Antarctic fur seals breed
mainly on South Georgia Island and range north of the ice pack to the conver-
gence east of Drakes Passage.  Sub-Antarctic fur seals are rare south of
the Antarctic Convergence and have not been sighted in the Weddell Sea
region.  Distribution, habitat, and food items for these seals are indicated
in Table 8 and Figure 32.

Whales--Cetacean species likely to occur in the Weddell Sea are listed
in Table 9.  In austral summer, the larger whales migrate to antarctic
waters, where they feed intensively.  Baleen whales may increase their
body weights up to 50 percent at this time.  Lesser increases occur among
sperm whales (Laws 1977a; BIOMASS 1977).  The distribution of these whales
is circumpolar, and the larger species and larger individuals within a
species tend to penetrate farther south, approaching the ice edge.  This
pattern, along with feeding specializations, results in an ecological separation
of species with respect to food resources.  Species distributions and preferred
food items are presented in Figure 32 and Table 9.  Most of these species
depend on a specific size fraction of the krill population.

Several species of small toothed whales (odontacetes) reside year-
round in the antarctic. The more common species are listed in Table 9.
With the exception of the killer whale, little is known about the roles
of these odontacetes in the ecosystem.  The killer whale is a top-order
predator, feeding on fish, squid, seals, penguins, and small whales.

Marine Birds--Bird species of the Weddell Sea are listed in Table
10.  Six species inhabit and nest on the Antarctic continent proper:  the
emperor and adelie penguins, Antarctic and snow petrels, Wilson's storm-
petrel, and south polar skua.  General at-sea distributions and approximate
locations of known major nesting areas are shown in Figure 33 (see Watson
1975 for detailed information).  These species plus the cape petrel, which
nests on South Georgia, South Sandwich, South Orkney, and South Shetland
Islands, constitute the principal seabird populations of the representative
drilling area.

Numerous less abundant bird species also inhabit the Weddell Sea (Table
10).  Four additional penguin species breed near the Weddell Sea, one of

which, the chinstrap penguin, ranges regularly into it (Figure 34). Some 
petrel species that breed outside the Southern Ocean (Figures 35 and 36) forage regularly into the Weddell Sea region. Several additional species of petrels from other subantarctic regions (Table 10) may also forage in the Weddell Sea in small numbers. Other species that may occur in the area include the blue-eyed shag, American sheathbill, kelp gull, brown skua, and Antarctic tern (Figure 37). The Arctic tern also forages throughout the region in austral summer, but returns to the northern hemisphere in austral winter.

Most of the seabirds that occur regularly in the Weddell Sea region during the year (Figures 33-37) (see Cline et al. 1969; Tuck 1975; Watson 1975; Harrison 1983) are present only in ice-free areas. Emperor penguins, adelie penguins, and prions inhabit the shallow areas of the Weddell Sea. The other common species forage in deeper waters of the outer continental shelf and in pelagic waters. Large numbers of offshore-foraging species nest in coastal areas but do not forage in the nearshore habitat. However, due to the narrow shelf within the Weddell Sea, populations of shore-based breeders and offshore-based visitors forage relatively close to shore. Different species forage in different habitats. Important foraging areas include the ice edge, leads, and the shelf edge areas. Birds reportedly concentrate in the area of the Antarctic Convergence, although this feature may not be as important as generally believed (Ainley unpublished manuscript). Overall distribution and abundance vary temporally with ice conditions and extent.

Relative to habitats at lower latitudes, species diversity on the Antarctic continent proper is low. Diversities on the Antarctic Peninsula and on islands throughout the Southern Ocean are slightly higher.  Abundances of specific seabird species inhabiting the Weddell Sea are not well-studied, but number of individuals per species is generally high. For example, relatively high densities were found for adelie penguins and a few other species in the Weddell Sea (Cline et al. 1969; Tuck 1975). In addition, Ainley (unpublished manuscript) described bird density in the general antarctic zone as 9.5/km2 (SD=7.4). This compares with bird density of 3.4/km2 (SD=2.9) in the tropical zone. Biomass in the antarctic was also much greater (e.g., 10 times) than that of the tropics (Ainley unpublished manuscript). Both biomass and numbers of the antarctic seabird population are dominated by penguins (Laws 1985).

Endangered Species--

Five endangered cetacean species are known to occur in the antarctic region and one additional endangered cetacean species is a probable resident (SCAR 1977). The endangered species include the fin whale, blue whale, sei whale, humpback whale, right whale, and sperm whale. Baleen whales migrate into antarctic waters during the austral summer to feed and are found south of the Antarctic Convergence from November through March. Right whales are found south of the convergence only occasionally. One-third of the male sperm whale stock is assumed to feed south of the convergence during the summer months.

The Ross seal, the Antarctic fur seal, and the sub-Antarctic fur seal are listed as specially protected species by the Agreed Measures for the

Biologically Sensitive Areas--

The major concern in the antarctic is the fragile terrestrial ecosystem.  The marine ecosystem is considered to be relatively robust, with environmental conditions that are less extreme, more uniform, and more continuous than those on land.  These factors tend to increase the stability of the system (SCAR 1982).  Even though the relatively simple ecosystem of the Southern Ocean is susceptible to perturbation, its continuous circumpolar distribution reduces the potential that a single point source of perturbation will result in any long-term change in the ecosystem.  Portions of the marine environment that could be considered most sensitive are the ice-edge community, rookeries of marine mammals, and nesting sites of marine birds.

Georges Bank

Phytoplankton--

Two dominant hydrographic features interact to promote extremely high primary production in spring, summer, and fall on Georges Bank.  A slow, anticyclonic gyre tends to retain plankters within the euphotic zone of a single water mass over the shallow portions of the bank [i.e., less than 50-80 m (164-262 ft) deep].  In addition, strong, rotary tidal currents lead to vertical mixing of the water mass over the shallow portions of the bank and thus to an abundant supply of dissolved nutrients for phyto-plankton growth and reproduction (Riley 1982).

Primary production on Georges Bank is typically 300-500 g C.m-2.yr-1.  This is two to five times greater than the primary productivity of New England coastal waters (100-150 g C.m-2.yr-1), and is comparable to that of productive estuaries and coastal upwelling areas (Riley 1982).  The high standing stocks of benthic invertebrates and fishes on Georges Bank (discussed below) demonstrate the high primary production which typifies this area.

The standing crop of phytoplankton is highest in April.  Production also peaks during this month, especially in shallow water, although periodic blooms of algae also occur in shallow water during summer and early fall (Riley 1982).  Algal blooms may be inhibited by nutrient depletion, declining phytoplankton growth rates, phytoplankton senescence (which leads to their sinking out of the water column), consumption by zooplankton, and reduced light penetration due to high phytoplankton densities (i.e., self-shading) (Riley 1982).

Species composition of the phytoplankton population on Georges Bank varies spatially and temporally.  Taxa that may be numerically abundant during one or more times of the year include two dinoflagellate species and numerous species of diatoms (Bigelow 1926).

105
Zooplankton--

Zooplankton are the major trophic link between the phytoplankton and 
higher trophic levels (primarily fishes and benthos) on Georges Bank (Figure 
38). Standing stocks of zooplankton are slightly higher than standing 
crops of phytoplankton during most seasons of the year, but secondary production 
by zooplankton averages only 20 percent of the primary production (Riley 
1982). Median standing stocks of <25-130 cc/100 m3 were reported for the 
spring, summer, and autumn of 1977 (Sherman et al. 1978).

Both meroplankton and holoplankton are important components of the 
zooplankton on Georges Bank. For most benthic and demersal species with 
planktonic young, larvae are released into the water column in the spring 
or summer, when primary and secondary production are high and larval food 
supply is adequate. Fish larvae occur on Georges Bank throughout the year, 
however, since the periods of occurrence for many species tend to be successive 
rather than simultaneous (Sherman et al. 1978). Larvae released into the 
highly productive waters of Georges Bank tend to be maintained there by 
the slow, anticyclonic gyre. When the gyre persists during the warm months, 
recruitment of larval forms into benthic and demersal habitats may be enhanced.

Successful nurture and recruitment of meroplankters supports the fisheries 
resources of Georges Bank in two ways. First, many of the meroplankters 
are species of benthic invertebrates that will later be consumed by fishes. 
Second, many of the meroplankters are fish larvae. Of the 200 species 
of fish reported from Georges Bank, 26 are known to spawn there (U.S. Bureau 
of Land Management 1979), including the commercially valuable cod, haddock, 
yellowtail flounder, pollock, and silver hake. Most of these species have 
pelagic eggs and larvae.

Many commercially valuable species of benthic invertebrates, including 
sea scallops and lobsters, also have pelagic larvae. The unique circulation 
of Georges Bank may promote rapid growth, development, and settling of 
lobster larvae that are recruited into the coastal waters of southern Nova 
Scotia, the Bay of Fundy, and Maine (Harding et al. 1983).

Holoplankton of Georges Bank include copepods, chaetognaths, euphausids, 
coelenterates, cladocerans, salps, appendicularians, and ostracods (Sherman 
et al. 1978). Copepods are the most abundant group, accounting for 75 
percent or more of the individuals. Of the 36 species collected by Sherman 
et al. (1978), three are considered numerical dominants.

Nekton--

About 200 species of fishes occur on Georges Bank (Bigelow and Schroeder 
1953). Together with the squids, these species constitute the nektonic 
community. Secondary production by nektonic species is very high on Georges 
Bank due to high primary and secondary production rates by planktonic species.

Important commercial and sport fisheries species are listed in Table 11. 
Yellowtail flounder, cusk, and winter flounder are essentially non-migratory, 
while bluefish, butterfish, silver hake, mackerel, halibut, cod, haddock, 
red hake, pollock, herring, alewives, and shad migrate on and off the bank 
in an onshore-offshore direction or a north-south direction (U.S. Bureau

of Land Management 1979). Eleven of the species in Table 11 spawn on Georges Bank, as do an additional 15 species that are not listed (U.S. Bureau of Land Management 1979).

Georges Bank has supported commercial and recreational fisheries for three centuries. These fisheries may be divided into four resource blocks (Edwards 1982):

-   Cods, including cod, hake, and haddock (Table 11). Harvests for 1962-1977 averaged 260,000 mt/yr.

-   Herrings, including Atlantic herring, shad, and alewives. Harvests for 1962-1977 averaged 230,000 mt/yr.

-   Pelagic species, primarily mackerel, bluefish, and tuna. The target of intensive fisheries only recently, these species have sustained harvests of about 200,000 mt/yr.

-   Flounders, principally yellowtail and winter flounders, which are harvested at a rate of about 50,000 mt/yr.

Fisheries stocks in the Middle Atlantic Bight, including Georges Bank, declined drastically during the 1960s and early 1970s (Clark and Brown 1977), primarily due to overfishing by foreign fleets. Environmental conditions and overfishing by the domestic fleet also contributed to the decline. During this 15-year decline, composition of the landings also changed, as fleets shifted from depleted stocks to relatively unharvested stocks. Landings of cods and other groundfish peaked in 1965, landings of herring peaked in 1969, and landings of mackerel peaked in 1973 (Edwards 1982). Declines in traditional fisheries stocks may have triggered changes in species composition, as evidenced by increased abundances of white hake, mackerel, and squids (Clark and Brown 1977). Although restrictions remain in effect for foreign fleets on Georges Bank, continued fishing pressure by domestic and Canadian fleets, coupled with the changed species composition, make it difficult to predict whether species composition and stocks will return to pre-1960 conditions.

Benthos--

Three benthic invertebrate species support major commercial fisheries: the highly prized northern lobster (Homarus americanus), the sea scallop (Placopecter magellanicus) and the deep-sea red crab (Geryon quinquedens) (U.S. Bureau of Land Management 1979). Less important species with commercial value include northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), surf clams (Spisula solidissima), ocean quahogs (Arctica islandica), and tanner crabs (Chionoecetes opilio) (Gusey 1977). Other benthic invertebrates are preyed upon by fishes and large epifaunal invertebrates (Figure 38).

In contrast to coastal stocks, lobsters inhabiting the outer continental shelf of Georges Bank and adjacent areas undergo extensive seasonal migrations (Cooper and Uzmann 1971). The observed shoreward migration during spring and summer may be required for molting and reproduction, since colder temperatures at the shelf edge may inhibit these activities (Cooper and Uzmann 1971). Because Georges Bank may be a critical spawning habitat

for coastal and offshore lobster stocks throughout the Gulf of Maine (Harding et al. 1983), the migrating stocks may be very important to commercial fisheries throughout the region.

A varied and abundant benthic invertebrate fauna is found on Georges Bank. Of the 926 infaunal and epifaunal taxa found in eight surveys during 1982 and 1983 over the southern portion of the bank (Maciolek-Blake et al. 1984), polychaetous annelids (378 species), crustaceans (178 species), and molluscs (148 species) were best represented. Numerically abundant species at depths less than 60 m (197 ft) included tanaid crustaceans, polychaetous annelids, bivalve molluscs, and echinoids. At depths of 70-80 m (230-262 ft), polychaetous annelids, amphipods, and oligochaetes were abundant, while at depths of 100-145 m (329-476 ft), amphipods and polychaetous annelids were abundant.

Numbers of infaunal species and infaunal abundances at the sampling stations were reasonably consistent at a given station over the eight survey periods, but varied considerably among stations (Maciolek-Blake et al. 1984). Numbers of species generally ranged from 40 to 150 per 0.24 m^(2) (2.6 ft^(2)), while numbers of individuals generally ranged from 300 to 2,000 per 0.04 m^(2) (0.43 ft^(2)). The investigators (Maciolek-Blake et al. 1984) concluded that community structure was reasonably constant through time at a given station, but varied spatially over the survey area. Differences in community structure among stations were highly correlated with depth and sediment type.

Epifaunal communities also varied with depth and sediment type. Stations at depths of 60-80 m (197-262 ft) exhibited sandy substrates and were populated by sand dollars, hydroid colonies, snails, crabs, and sea stars. At depths of about 100 m (328 ft), the sandy-silty sediments were populated by sea stars, sponges, anemones, sea scallops, and hydroids, plus several species of demersal fishes. Asteroids, onuphid polychaetes, crabs, and demersal fishes were abundant at greater depths [140-145 m (459-476 ft)].

Biota of the numerous canyons on the southern flank of Georges Bank has not been sampled extensively. However, several species of corals have been observed (by submersible) at the head of Lydonia Canyon, including sea pens, the yellow gorgonian Paramurcea borealis, the red octocoral Antho-mastus agassizi, and the pink solitary coral Desmophyllum cristagalli (U.S. Bureau of Land Management 1979). These species probably occur in other canyons, as well.

Marine Mammals and Birds--

Seals--Seal species likely to inhabit the Georges Bank region are listed in Table 12. Coastal and nearshore waters of the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank provide habitat for gray, harbor, harp, and hooded seals. Only harbor and gray seals occur in large numbers or with any regularity in this region. While none of these species is on the Federal list of endangered or threatened species, reliable population estimates and trends for neither the harp nor the hooded seal exist.

In general, seals are concentrated along rocky coastlines, which provide remote haulout areas for feeding (all species), resting (all species), and pupping (harbor seal only). Small populations (less than 300 individuals)

are listed in Table 12.

    Whales--Cetacean species likely to inhabit the Georges Bank region 
are listed in Table 13.  The baleen whales occur throughout the region 
but tend to occupy the shallower shelf waters.  Feeding specialization 
results in resource partitioning and reduced competition, allowing different 
species to feed in common areas (Table 13).  The endangered right whale 
has a small breeding population (less than 100 individuals) in the Bay 
of Fundy.  The sperm whale, (an odontocete) inhabits deeper waters, with 
concentrations along the shelf break [1,000-m (3,281-ft) depth].  Its range 
extends offshore into pelagic waters.

    Seventeen species of small odontacetes are likely to occur in the 
Georges Banks region (Table 13).  The killer whale and harbor porpoise 
are the most common year-round inhabitants.  More seasonal in occurrence 
are the pilot whale and dolphins (e.g., bottlenose, common, white-beaked, 
Atlantic white-sided, and striped dolphins).  Several species are occasional 
or irregular inhabitants to the region (i.e., Risso's dolphin, pygmy sperm 
whale, beluga whale, and many species of beaked whales).  Species distributions 
and preferred food items are presented in Table 13.

    Marine Birds --Seabird species that nest in coastal areas of the Gulf 
of Maine and Cape Cod are indicated in Table 14.  Only six species that 
nest in this region forage regularly in offshore areas (e.g., Georges Bank). 
Two of these species (herring gull and great black-backed gull) also forage 
in nearshore areas [<20 m (66 ft) depth].  Nine additional species breed 
in the region, but forage primarily in nearshore habitats.  Several species 
of wading birds (i.e., herons and ibises) also breed in the region and 
forage in estuarine habitats (see Erwin and Korschgen 1979 for details 
of locations).

    A group of nine bird species visits offshore areas in the region during 
summer and fall (Table 15).  The northern fulmar, which nests in Newfoundland, 
occurs during summer in small numbers.  The other species originate from 
either the eastern north Atlantic (Cory's, Manx, and Audubon's shearwaters) 
or from the southern hemisphere (greater and sooty shearwaters, Wilson's 
and white-faced storm-petrels, south polar skua).  While these species can be divided 
into "cool" and "warm" water species, their distributions overlap and oceano-
graphic variations result in great variations in annual occurrence (Vickery 
1981).  Cory's shearwaters, Audubon shearwaters, and white-faced storm 
petrels are associated with the Gulf Stream.  The remaining species generally 
are not, although they migrate over the Gulf Stream to foraging areas in 
cool, northern waters.

    A group of ten seabird species normally occurs in offshore waters 
while migrating between nesting areas in the northern hemisphere and wintering 
areas to the south (Table 15).  In the fall, this group coexists with the 
summer visitors to form the largest seasonal population in the outer areas 
of Georges Bank.

                                           fall migration have been noted.  Most sitings are nearshore
                                           or within the 200-m (656-ft) contour.  Feeds on fish
                                           (e.g., herring, capelin).

Seabird species that winter in the Georges Bank region are listed 
in Table 16, subdivided by habitat (i.e., nearshore, offshore).  Many species 
of divers, waterfowl, and gulls increase species variety during winter.

Figure 39 indicates foraging areas of nesting species listed in Table 14.  
The figure also shows nesting sites of three species that nest in only 
a few areas.  Atlantic puffins and razorbills, which nest at only a very 
few sites in the Georges Bank region(Erwin and Korschgen 1979), and Leach's 
storm-petrel, which breeds at perhaps a dozen sites and probably forages 
well offshore (i.e., at the edge of the continental shelf or in pelagic 
waters).  Nesting populations of these species are small.  Most of the 
region's nesting population of about 230,000 seabirds consists of gulls 
and terns that normally forage near shore (Table 14).  These species will 
occasionally range farther to areas of food concentrations (e.g., near 
fishing vessels on Georges Bank).

Distributions of the offshore summer-fall visitors are characterized 
in Figure 40.  These birds dominate the seasonal populations in numbers 
and, depending on how oceanographic conditions affect distributions of 
prey, can be found throughout the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank.  They 
are relatively uncommon in nearshore waters, but may concentrate at shallow 
banks near shorelines (e.g., Nantucket Shoals, Stellwagen Bank).  Large 
numbers of birds are found in most seasons in the Gulf of Maine (see Tingley 
1983), though recorded densities are low in the deeper waters of the gulf.  
Species variety in southern New England waters is greater than elsewhere 
in the Gulf of Maine but numbers are relatively low (U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management 1979).  Low densities of birds have been reported for the crest 
of Georges Bank.  However, sites of commercial fishing activity can attract 
very large numbers of birds, and large concentrations of greater shearwaters, 
sooty shearwaters, and Wilson's storm-petrels have been reported at fishing 
vessels on Georges Bank.  Concentrations of seasonal offshore birds (Table 15) 
have been reported during summer for the shelf break, canyons, and continental 
slope at the eastern and southern edges of Georges Bank.  For example, 
northern gannets migrating from Canada are reported in large numbers in 
this area in fall.  Red phalaropes are also abundant in the region and 
concentrate in this area.

During the winter months, additional species inhabit the region (Table 
16).  The large gulls (herring, lesser black-backed, glaucous, great black-
backed), the abundant, pelagically-wintering northern fulmar, and black-legged 
kittiwake dominate the offshore population in winter.  The alcid species 
are rather thinly distributed, with Atlantic puffins and razorbills reported 
from Georges Bank and the canyons and outer slope (U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management 1979).  In winter the nearshore habitats of the region support 
populations of loons, grebes, cormorants, ducks, gulls, terns, and other 
species.  Georges Bank is an important foraging region for many birds, 
including several species of alcids, during winter months.

The greatest species variety and numbers of seabirds occur on outer 
Georges Bank in summer through fall, when large numbers of shearwaters, 
storm-petrels, gannets, and gulls are present.  The nearshore and shallow 
offshore habitats are used by birds nesting within the region, including 
offshore foragers (e.g., red-necked phalaropes, gulls, terns, and black guillemots), 
and estuarine species (e.g., herons).  Shorebirds

between nesting areas to the north and wintering areas to the south.

Endangered Species--

    Three endangered and two threatened species of sea turtles inhabit 
the north Atlantic.  Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), leatherback (Der-
mochelvs coriacea), and Atlantic Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) sea turtles 
are endangered.  Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) 
sea turtles are threatened.  Loggerhead sea turtles are the most abundant 
species in the region, followed by the leatherback, and Atlantic Ridley.  
Green sea turtles prefer southern habitats and visit the region only 
occasionally.  Hawksbill sea turtles are generally considered to be accidental 
visitors in the north Atlantic.

    Six endangered species of cetaceans inhabit the north Atlantic region 
(CETAP 1982):  fin whale, humpback whale, right whale, sei whale, sperm 
whale, and blue whale.  Fin whales are the most abundant large whale in 
the region.  Humpback whales are the next most commonly sighted species.  
Based on its low population, the right whale is probably the most endangered 
marine mammal in the region.  The Bay of Fundy supports a breeding population 
of right whales.  The sperm whale is only an occasional visitor on the 
continental shelf.  Areas of concentrated occurrences in feeding and breeding 
are shown in Figure 41.

    Two species of petrels that forage in the Gulf Stream offshore the 
Georges Bank region have very small populations.  The black-capped petrel 
(Pterodroma hasitata), has a population of only a few thousand and is rated 
vulnerable by the Red Data Book (King 1981).  The Bermuda petrel (P. cahow) 
has been reduced to a population of about 30 pairs and is endangered (King 
1981).  The potential that either species will occur in proximity to ODP 
operations is small, due to small population sizes and large foraging ranges.

Biologically Sensitive Areas--

    The entire Georges Bank area is considered biologically sensitive 
due to its extensive fisheries area.  Commercial fishing near Georges Bank 
represents 13 percent of the total U.S. landings by volume and 15 percent 
by dollar value.  Details on the commercial fisheries are presented below 
in the discussion of other uses of representative drilling areas.

Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean

Phytoplankton--

    Standing crops of phytoplankton are highest in upwelling areas near 
the coast and decrease westward.  Highest primary production also occurs 
in upwelling areas near the coast, in the vicinity of the Mid-American 
Trench, and decreases westward.  Overall, primary production in the eastern 
tropical Pacific is relatively high (Holmes et al. 1957) and supports con-
siderable biomass at higher tropic levels.  Some of this biomass (e.g., 
tunas, anchoveta) is harvested commercially.

The east-to-west decrease in primary production is directly related
to the upwelling of deeper water near the coast and to the depth of the
thermocline relative to the compensation depth offshore.  The deeper water
upwelled near the coast promotes high standing stocks of phytoplankton
and high primary production values (Blackburn 1966), although the exact
processes by which this occurs are not well-understood.  The thermocline
is relatively deep [i.e., 20-40 m (66-131 ft)] nearshore, due to the upwelling
of colder water (Blackburn et al. 1970). Westward, the thermocline shoals
at 10-20 m (33-66 ft) at about 1000 W longitude. As the shoal thermocline
is depressed by wind mixing, nutrients mixed into the surface waters promote
primary production. Production is high in the areas of shoal thermocline
because the compensation depth is below the thermocline.  However, as the
thermocline to the east of 1000 W longitude deepens, production drops because
the thermocline is depressed below the compensation depth, and phytoplankters
are advected out of the euphotic zone.

A second source of variation in phytoplankton standing crops and production
is seasonality. Standing crops, as indicated by chlorophyll a values,
are 14-28 mg/m2 over the upper 150 m (492 ft) (Blackburn et al. 1970),
varying annually by a factor of almost two. They are highest from April
to September and lowest from October to January (Blackburn et al. 1970).
Mean annual primary production in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is
about 75 g C.m-2.yr-1, but there is considerable spatial and temporal variation
(Owen and Zeitschel 1970). Depending on the station location and season,
values from <100 to >500 mg C.m-2.day-1 may be found (average of 127-318
mg C.m-2.day-1) (Owen and Zeitschel 1970). Maximum production occurs in
the early spring, with a secondary peak in August or September.  Minimum
production occurs in October or November. Seasonal production cycles appear
to vary synchronously over the entire region (Owen and Zeitschel 1970).

Phytoplankton species composition has not been adequately described
in the representative drilling areas.  However, phytoplankton communities
just to the west (i.e., 125-1550 W longitude) are dominated by flagellates,
monads, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates, and diatoms.

Zooplankton--

Zooplankton populations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean exhibit
many of the same characteristics as do the phytoplankton populations.
Principally, zooplankton stocks decrease from east to west, with peaks
in areas of upwelling areas and in areas of shoal thermocline (Blackburn
et al. 1970). In addition, zooplankton stocks decrease greatly below the
pycnocline (Beers and Stewart 1971), as do phytoplankton stocks.  For the
upper 300 m (984 ft) of the water column, about 50 percent of the zooplankton
standing stock occurs at depths of 0-70 m (0-230 ft), about 30 percent
occurs at depths of 70-140 m (230-459 ft), and about 20 percent occurs
at depths of 140-300 m (459-984 ft) (Blackburn 1966). This close association
of zooplankton and phytoplankton stocks is due to the thickening of the
mixed layer from east to west, and to the dependence of the herbivorous
zooplankters on the phytoplankton.

As noted above for phytoplankton, zooplankton standing stocks vary
seasonally by a factor of approximately two (Blackburn et al. 1970; Longhurst
1976). Zooplankton volumes offshore (i.e., 10-1200 W longitude) range

123
from 80 to 160 ml/1,000 m3 (Blackburn et al. 1970).  In the easternmost 
part of the region, volumes typically range from 130 to 320 ml/1,000 m3,
but may be greater in coastal upwelling areas (Holmes et al. 1957).  Variations 
in chlorophyll a and day zooplankton stocks are "almost indistinguishable 
in phase" (Blackburn et al. 1970).  Moreover, zooplankton stocks appear 
to be closely associated with the zones of maximum phytoplankton production 
in the water column (Longhurst 1976; Beers and Stewart 1971).  For the 
eastern tropical Pacific Ocean as a whole, zooplankton standing stocks 
vary with chlorophyll a estimates to the power of approximately 0.7 in 
all areas for all seasons (Blackburn 1973). Thus, zooplankton biomass 
does not increase linearly with the standing crop of phytoplankton, and 
it appears that ecological efficiency decreases between oligotrophic and 
eutrophic areas within the region.

    By volume, the most abundant zooplankton taxa in the eastern tropical 
Pacific are copepods (20 percent), tunicates (15 percent), chaetognaths 
(12 percent), siphonophores (8 percent), euphausiids (5 percent), medusae 
(3 percent), decapods (2 percent), amphipods (1 percent), and ostracods 
(less than 1 percent) (Mais and Jow 1960).  These same taxonomic groups 
are also most important numerically: copepods (63 percent), chaetognaths 
(15 percent), tunicates (6 percent), euphausiids (5 percent), siphonophores 
(1 percent), ostracods (1 percent), amphipods (less than 1 percent), decapods 
(less than 1 percent), and medusae (less than 1 percent) (Mais and Jow 
1960).

    Microzooplankton (i.e., animals passing through a 363-u mesh but retained 
on a 35-u mesh) contribute an average 24 percent of the macrozooplankton 
biomass to the total zooplankton standing stock (Beers and Stewart 1971). 
The most important contributors to microzooplankton abundances are copepods, 
tintinnid ciliates, radiolarians, acantharians, and foraminifera (Beers 
and Stewart 1971).

Nekton--

    Nekton may be classified into two groups based on motility and size: 
micronekton [limited motility, 1-10 cm (0.4-4.0 in) long, may be captured 
in a large, coarse-meshed plankton net] and nekton organisms [high motility, 
longer than 10 cm (0.4 in), can easily avoid nets and trawls].  Micronekton 
in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are primarily fish, crustaceans, 
and cephalopods. Some species are permanent members of the micronekton, 
while others are temporary members (i.e., during only their larval and 
juvenile stages).  Ten families and one suborder constitute over 90 percent 
of the micronekton by volume in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean: the 
fish families Myctophidae (lanternfishes) and Gonostomatidae (lightfishes); 
the crustacean families Euphausiidae (krill), Penaeidae (shrimps), Squillidae 
(mantis shrimps), Portunidae (crabs), and Sergestidae (shrimps); and the 
caphalopod family Enoploteuthidae (squids) (Blackburn 1968).  However, 
the remaining 10 percent by volume consists of many other taxonomic groups, 
including 51 families and three orders of fishes (Ahlstrom 1972).  Many 
of these are larval forms, the most abundant of which are the myctophid 
lanternfishes (47 percent), gonostomatid lightfishes (23 percent), sternoptychid 
hatchetfishes (6 percent), bathylagid smelts (5 percent), and scrombrid 
tunas and mackerels (2 percent) (Ahlstrom 1971).  Most micronektonic taxa 
are probably carnivorous, except for the micronektonic crustaceans, which

124
are probably a mixture of herbivores, primary carnivores, and some secondary 
carnivores (Blackburn et al. 1970).

The distribution of micronekton standing stocks  is similar to that 
of phytoplankton and zooplankton:  stocks are highest in the coastal zone 
and decrease gradually to the west (Blackburn et al. 1970).  Standing stocks 
of micronektonic fish range from 27-81 ml/1,000 m3 in nearshore areas to 
0.3-1.0 ml/1,000 m3 (or less) in the vicinity of the offshore drilling 
sites. Similarly, stocks of micronektonic crustaceans and cephalopods 
each range from 3.1-9.0 ml/1,000 m3 nearshore to less than 0.3 ml/1,000 m3 
offshore (Blackburn 1968).  Seasonal variations in the standing stocks 
of micronektonic crustaceans are apparently not statistically significant 
(P>0.05). However, seasonal variations in the standing stocks of micronektonic 
fish plus cephalopods are significant (P<0.05) and are nearly opposite 
in phase to variations in plankton stocks (Blackburn et al. 1970).

Tunas are the most important large nektonic species because they are 
harvested commercially. Yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack (Euthynnus 
pelamis) tunas constitute most of the catch in the vicinity of the Mid-
American Trench, but bigeye tunas (T. obesus) are also harvested (Mais 
and Jow 1960). The yellowfin tuna fishery in the vicinity of the Mid-American 
Trench is especially productive due to the shallowing of the thermocline 
in that region (Mais and Jow 1960). Other tunas in the area in low abundances 
include bullet mackerel (Auxis rochei), black skipjack tuna (E. lineatus), 
and albacore tuna (T. alalunga) (Mais and Jow 1960; Shingu et al. 1974).

Billfishes are also harvested in the representative drilling areas, 
principally by the Japanese. The most important species are the sailfish 
(Istiophorus platypterus), shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), 
and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax). Swordfish (Xiphias gladius), black 
marlin (Maka? indica), and blue marlin (M. nigricans) are also caught.

Other abundant large nektonic organisms in the eastern tropical Pacific 
are sharks, lancet fishes, flying fishes, dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), 
wahoo, ocean sunfish, and squids (Mais and Jow 1960; Office of Ocean Minerals 
and Energy 1981). Dolphinfish and sharks are very abundant, contributing 
roughly half of the longline catch (Mais and Jow 1960). The most common 
shark species are the requiems and the threshers.

Benthos--

Benthos have not been sampled in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean 
within the representative drilling areas (see Rowe 1983). However, using 
studies in nearby regions, benthic communities expected to occur in the 
representative drilling areas can be characterized in general. Two types 
of benthic communities are expected: soft-bottom communities and hydrothermal 
vent communities. Soft-bottom communities were surveyed west of the repre-
sentative drilling areas (i.e., 8-160 N latitude and 125-1520 W longitude) 
as part of the Deep Ocean Mining Environmental Study (DOMES).  Benthic 
organisms at three sites were surveyed by photography, free-fall baited 
traps, and box cores. Photographs documented that more than 90 percent 
of the larger, epifaunal organisms were sea stars (Cl. Asteroidea), brittle 
stars (Cl. Ophiuroidea), sea anemones (Cl. Anthozoa), sea cucumbers (Cl. 
Holothuroidea), and sponges (Phy. Porifera) (Office of Ocean Minerals and 

125
Energy 1981). Sea spiders (Phy. Pycnogonida), crabs (Cl. Decapoda), isopod 
crustaceans, and sea urchins (Cl. Echinoidea) were also observed. Amphipod 
crustaceans and two families of fishes [rattails (Fam. Macrouridae) and 
sea snails (Fam. Liparidae)] were collected in baited traps. These scavenging 
organisms may be considered bentho-pelagic because of their close association 
with the bottom.

Benthic macrofaunal communities sampled by box corer were characterized 
by low abundances (x = 121 organisms/m^(2); range = 36-268 organisms/m^(2)) and 
high diversities (i.e., species richness), as is typical of abyssal environments 
(Hecker and Paul 1979). Among the 381 species collected in the 80 0.25-m^(2) 
box core samples, 131 were represented by a single specimen, 58 by two 
specimens, 51 by three specimens, and 36 by four specimens. Plots of the 
expected numbers of species per numbers of individuals revealed that the 
fauna was greatly undersampled. Hence, only a fraction of the resident 
species were represented in the large box core samples.

The most abundant species were polychaetous annelids (40.1 percent), 
tanaid crustaceans (19.5 percent), isopod crustaceans (11.7 percent), bivalve 
molluscs (8.4 percent), ectoprocts (5.4 percent), gastropod molluscs (2.5 
percent), and brachiopods (2.1 percent). An additional 20 taxonomic groups 
were represented at densities less than 1 percent of the total infauna. 
About 81 percent of all macrofaunal organisms were characterized by Hecker 
and Paul (1979) as deposit feeders. The remaining 19 percent were characterized 
as suspension feeders.

Meiofaunal organisms retained on a 300-u mesh sieve were also collected 
and analyzed by Hecker and Paul (1979). Nematodes, ostracods, and copepods 
were the most abundant meiofaunal taxa, accounting for 82.5 percent, 9.6 
percent, and 7.5 percent of the total numbers of meiofaunal organisms, 
respectively.

Hecker and Paul (1979) also conducted classification analyses that 
strongly suggest that benthic communities vary in species composition over 
the eastern tropical Pacific region. Hence, it is unrealistic to expect 
the same benthic species at the same proportions in the representative 
drilling areas as were observed by Hecker and Paul (1979) in the DOMES 
survey area. Macrofaunal densities may also differ (i.e., be higher) in 
the representative drilling areas because of the higher levels of primary 
production which occur near the coast. Benthic communities are largely 
dependent on organic "rain" from the surface layers of the ocean for nutrients, 
and higher primary production is often reflected in higher benthic standing 
stocks and secondary production. The composition and quantity of the organic 
"rain" also greatly influences the character of the sediments within a 
given region. Therefore, sediments may differ somewhat in the representative 
drilling areas from the pelagic clays, siliceous oozes, and calcareous 
sediments found in the DOMES survey area.

The second type of benthic community expected in the eastern tropical 
Pacific is associated with hydrothermal vents. Hydrothermal vents have 
been documented on the Galapagos Rift at 00 47.5' N latitude and on the 
East Pacific Rise at 210 N latitude (Corliss et al. 1979, Spiess et al. 1980). 
They have not been documented on the East Pacific Rise in the vicinity 
of the representative drilling site, but they probably occur there also.

126
Hydrothermal vents occur in association with active spreading centers.
Cold sea water is entrained into the fissure system along the ridge axis,
flows through the warm (sometimes hot) oceanic crust, and exits at warm
water vents.  Temperatures as high as 3800 + 300 C have been recorded for
the exiting waters, which are rich in hydrogen sulfide (Corliss et al. 1979).
High densities of sulphur-oxidizing and heterotrophic bacteria have been
observed in water samples collected at two vent orifices (Corliss et al. 1979).
The bacteria which oxidize hydrogen sulfide are the primary producers which
support extensive epifaunal communities along the mid-ocean ridges (Edmond
and Von Damm 1983; Jannasch 1984; Somero 1984).

The extensive epifaunal communities live in close association with
the vents. Species composition varies somewhat among the vents in each
area and between areas (Corliss et al. 1979; Spiess et al. 1980).  However,
bivalve molluscs, crabs, pogonophorans, shrimps, gastropods, copepods,
six families of polychaetous annelids, and one species of brotulid fish
appear to be common in vent habitats (Jones 1981b). Serpulid and terebellid
polychaetous annelids formed dense tube masses on the East Pacific Rise
(Spiess et al. 1980), while aggregations of mytilid mussels and anemones
were observed on the Galapagos Rift (Corliss et al. 1979).

Hydrothermal vent habitats are unique and their ecology (e.g., energy
and nutrient sources, recruitment of organisms into newly generated vent
systems) is not well-known. Yet it appears that growth rates of the bivalve
molluscs in these vent communities are high, being comparable with those
for shallow water species. Such high growth rates are in contrast with
the extremely low growth rates estimated for a non-vent deep-sea bivalve
mollusc (Turner and Lutz 1984). Perhaps the most intriguing of the vent
organisms is the pogonophoran Riftia pachyptila, which grows in assemblages
of tubes, each 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 in) in diameter and up to 3 m (10 ft) tall.
Remarkably, this large animal lacks a functional gut. It is postulated
that R. pachyptila is an autotroph capable of generating energy through
the reduction of hydrogen sulfide, or that it derives its energy and nutrients
from symbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Cavanaugh et al. 1981; Felbeck
1981; Jones 1981a; Rau 1981). The latter hypothesis is supported by the
finding of large numbers of symbiotic bacteria within the trophosome of
the organism. It is postulated that these bacteria form organic carbon
compounds using carbon dioxide and energy from the reduction of hydrogen
sulfide (Jones 1984).

Marine Mammals and Birds--

Seals--Three species of otarids that could range into the two repre-
sentative site areas inhabit the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.  The Galapagos
fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and a subspecies of the California
sea lion [the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus californianus wollebaeki)]
breed in the Galapagos Islands.  The Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus
townsendi) breeds on Guadalupe Island off of Baja California and ranges
south to near the East Pacific Rise. All three species prefer inaccessible
rocky beaches for haulouts. The two fur seals also use sea caves. Both
fur seal populations number only about 1,000 individuals and are recovering
from near extinction due to exploitation. The Galapagos sea lion has a
more stable population of around 20,000. All three species apparently
feed on fish and cephalopods.

127
Whales--Cetacean species likely to inhabit the eastern tropical Pacific 
are listed in Table 17.  Baleen whales in the region include blue, fin, 
sei, Bryde's, minke, grey, and humpback whales. All baleen whales, except 
Bryde's whale, are transient in the region.  These transients migrate to 
lower latitudes to breed during winter months and feed little, if at all, 
during their stay. Many toothed cetaceans also inhabit the region.  Species 
that occur individually or in small groups, and that feed mainly on squid 
or large fish include sperm, pygmy sperm, pygmy killer, false killer, pilot, 
melon-headed, and goose-beaked whales; various beaked whales of the genus 
Mesplodon; and Risso's dolphin. Distributions and preferred food items 
are presented in Table 17.

Small delphinids in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean occur mainly 
in large interspecific herds. They feed mostly on squids and small, schooling, 
surface and mesopelagic fish. In order of estimated abundances, these 
species are spotted, spinner, common, bottlenose, stripped, Frazer's, and 
rough-toothed dolphins (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization 1978). 
These large interspecific (or occasionally single-species) herds are associated 
with schools of yellowfin tuna that drive prey (e.g., small fish and squid) 
to the surface.  The delphinids, flocks of birds, tuna, and even sharks 
will feed in this aggregation. The delphinids' association with tuna has 
also resulted in drastic reductions in the stocks of several species, including 
spinner and spotted dolphins, from incidental takes by the tuna fishery. 
Distribution and food items for these delphinid species are presented in 
Table 17.

Marine Birds--Marine birds that may be affected by drilling activities 
in the two representative drilling sites may be divided into three groups: 
species occurring in nearshore, offshore, and pelagic waters of the repre-
sentative sites (Figure 42, Table 18), species occurring in shoreline habitats 
(Figure 42, Table 18), and pelagic species that might be affected only 
by drilling at the East Pacific Rise site (Figure 42, Table 19). Two additional 
groups inhabit the eastern tropical Pacific, but they occur several hundred 
kilometers from the representative drilling sites: species inhabiting 
the region of the Peru and Humboldt Currents (Figure 42, Table 19) and 
species found primarily in the Galapagos Islands (Figure 42, Table 19).

The total number of marine birds species in the eastern tropical Pacific 
throughout the year is high. However, most species are present for only 
part of the year and few species breed in the area (e.g., only eight species 
breed near the representative drilling sites) (Murphy 1936; de Schauensee 
1970; Harris 1974; American Ornithological Union 1983).  Resident species 
show few seasonal changes in distribution, and some species have variable 
or staggered nesting seasons.

Generalized at-sea distributions of marine birds, as synthesized from 
Love (1971), King (1974), Harrison (1983), and others, are shown in Figures 
43-48. However, the distribution of many pelagic species in the region 
is poorly documented.

Pelagic ranges of large petrels and shearwaters are shown in Figure 43. 
Four species breed in the eastern tropical Pacific and at least four others 
migrate through or spend their non-breeding season within the region.

Fin whalea          Balaenoptera            Migration pattern, behavior, and distribution resemble 
                    physalus                those of the blue whale. Stock size is larger.

Sei whalea          Balaenoptera            Similar migration pattern for breeding.  Inhabits both 
                    borealis                shallow coastal waters and deep ocean areas. May feed 
                                            occasionally while in the region on large zooplankton 
                                            and small shoaling fish.

Figure 48. General distribution of migrant boreal seabird 
species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
139
Eleven species of storm-petrels inhabit the region (Figure 44), although
several of these are associated primarily with the Peru Current system.
Storm-petrels in the vicinity of the representative drilling sites include
black and least storm-petrels from colonies north of the region, wedge-rumped
and band-rumped storm-petrels from the Galapagos Islands, Wilson's storm-
petrel from the antarctic, and Leach's storm-petrel.  Storm-petrels are
occasionally abundant in pelagic areas.

Five larger-sized marine bird species occur in the eastern tropical
Pacific, as shown in Figure 45. Except for the waved albatross, which
is endemic to the Galapagos and forages in the northern Peru Current,
these large birds inhabit the representative drilling sites. Red-billed
tropicbirds breed in several locations and forage over wide areas of the
Pacific Ocean. Brown pelicans are abundant and widespread, principally
along shorelines and nearshore habitats. The two frigatebirds breed in
the region and have pelagic distributions during the non-breeding season.

Boobies (Figure 46) are abundant in the region. Although they are
considered pelagic, booby populations are concentrated along the continental
shelves. They are one of the dominant species in nearshore habitats, such
as the Mid-American Trench, but may also be found widely at sea, often
feeding in large flocks where prey is abundant (e.g., in fronts, upwelling
areas).

Species of gulls and terns that nest in the region are shown in Figure 47.
Species that reside in or migrate to the northern Peru Current area are
also shown in Figure 47, including abundant species associated with cold
water habitats (e.g., albatrosses, petrels, and South American gulls).
Bridled, sooty and the two noddy tern species are likely to be found at
the representative drilling sites. The south polar skua, a pelagic migrant,
occurs rarely. The swallow-tailed gull has a limited population, nests
at just two areas, and forages essentially in the northern Peru Current.

Many North American species also migrate through or winter in the
region (Figure 48). Some of these species are abundant, particularly in
nearshore habitats within or near the Mid-American Trench (i.e., gulls
and terns). Another group of species migrates far offshore between northern
nesting areas and wintering areas as far south as Antarctica (e.g., Arctic
tern). Phalaropes may occur in large flocks throughout the region. Generally,
red-necked phalaropes are most abundant near shore, although they also
occur in many mid-ocean areas. Red phalaropes are most abundant in mid-ocean
areas. Jaegers are very sparsely distributed in the region. Sabine's
gull and Arctic terns may occur in flocks during migration, but few have
been sighted near representative drilling sites (Jehl 1974).

Abundances and densities of seabird species in pelagic tropical areas
are generally very low, and long periods of time may elapse between sightings
of even individual birds. However, concentrations of seabirds within the
two representatives site areas have been reported (Love 1971; Jehl 1974;
King 1974). Ainley (unpublished manuscript) described densities and biomass
for four generalized ecological zones of bird distribution. Bird density
in the tropical Pacific was 3.4/km2 (SD = 2.9), compared with bird density
in the antarctic of 9.5/km2 (SD = 7.4). Tropical biomass was only about
10 percent of antarctic biomass. Bird distribution at sea is generally
140
patchy, even in highly productive, high-latitude waters. Concentrations 
typically occur at oceanographic features (e.g., areas of upwelling at 
shelf edges or submarine canyons, current boundaries or fronts). Cold 
water regimes support much higher numbers of seabirds, and the Peru and 
Humboldt Currents support one of the densest seabird populations in the 
world.

Endangered Species--

Five endangered cetacean species may occur in the eastern tropical 
Pacific region:  the blue whale, fin whale, sei whale, humpback whale, 
and sperm whale (Marine Mammals Commission 1984).

Two endangered species of sea turtles inhabit the waters of the eastern 
tropical Pacific:  the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the Pacific 
Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
1982).

Two marine bird species are classified as endangered:  the dark-rumped 
petrel and Parkinson's petrel (King 1981).  The dark-rumped petrel breeds 
in the Galapagos and the Hawaiian Islands and its population of about 4,000 
pairs is considered endangered in both locations.  Parkinson's petrel breeds 
off New Zealand and may forage in both representative eastern tropic Pacific 
drilling sites.

Biologically Sensitive Areas--

Biologically sensitive areas in the eastern tropical Pacific include 
the Pacific coast of Mexico, which supports breeding populations of the 
endangered green and Pacific Ridley sea turtles; the Galapagos Islands, 
which support many endemic species; and other islands (e.g., Clipperton 
Island, Reville G?gedos), which support important seabird nesting habitat 
and, in places, entire seabird populations.

OTHER USES OF REPRESENTATIVE DRILLING AREAS

Weddell Sea

Commercial Fisheries--

Fish are relatively unimportant in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. 
Though small commercial fishing operations exist, mostly off South Georgia 
Island in the Scotia Sea and around Iles de Kerguelen (SCAR 1982), no commercial 
fishing occurs in the Weddell Sea.  Krill are harvested commercially in 
Antarctic waters on a small scale at present, but could become more heavily 
exploited.  Minke whales and some small odontacetes are taken from antarctic 
waters.  This harvest is expected to cease in 1986, when the International 
Whaling Commission ban on commercial whaling takes effect.  Sealing is 
restricted under the regulations of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Seals.  An international treaty establishes a regime for Conser-
vation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources (U.S. Department of State 1978) 
and regulates harvesting of Antarctic species.

141
Military Uses--

The Antarctic Treaty states that it is in the interest of all persons that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord. As a result, this area is not used for any military purposes.

Resource Development--

Presently, there is no resource development in the Weddell Sea region. In two reports on the antarctic environmental implications of possible mineral exploration and exploitation, SCAR (1981, 1982) suggested that offshore hydrocarbons could be the first mineral resource in Antarctica to be developed. Initial efforts are expected to take place either in the Ross Sea embayment or adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula, but not before the year 2000.

Other Scientific Research--

Scientific research is the principal activity on the continent of Antarctica and in its surrounding waters. Most research is conducted in glaciology, biological and medical sciences, earth sciences, upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, and ocean sciences. Most programs focus on environmental and resource-related research.

Scientific expeditions in the Weddell Sea have produced a substantial body of oceanographic data from the ice-free portion of the Weddell Sea, and interdisciplinary programs have defined relationships among a variety of processes in the Weddell Sea region.

Georges Bank

Commercial Fisheries--

The New England region, including the Georges Bank, supports a large commercial fishery representing 13 percent of total U.S. landings in terms of pounds and 15 percent in terms of dollars. In both weight and value, it is the third most important region in the U.S. (Minerals Management Service 1983c). Although the entire Georges Bank area is important for commercial fisheries, the Northeast Peak shelf break zone and the Georges Bank crest, bounded by the 60-m isobath, are the areas of greatest biological and economic importance.

Commercially important species on Georges Bank include cod, haddock, pollock, hake, herring, flounder, mackerel, lobster, crab, and sea scallop (see Table 11). In 1983, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated a maximum sustainable yield for Georges Bank stocks of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder to be 35,000 mt, 22,750 mt, and 5,000 mt, respectively (Minerals Management Service 1983c). These yields are much lower than comparable annual landings from 1962 to 1977 reported by Edwards (1982) and emphasize the depletion of these stocks.

142
Military Uses--

Portions of the water and air space of the Georges Bank area are used
for training, readiness, and support of U.S. national defense and security
interests. These activities normally occur in areas specifically designated
for such purposes. The controlling authorities for each operating area
are responsible for directing oceanic and air maneuvers and for coordinating
them with other endeavors, such as oil exploration activities or the ODP.
Overall responsibility for the Offshore Military Activities Program is
vested in the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower Reserve Affairs
and Logistics). Under the policy specified in 32 CFR 252, the Department
of Defense will accomodate the joint use of such areas with other agencies
and with the public to the maximum extent feasible. Currently designated
areas in the vicinity of Georges Bank are the Boston Operating Area, along
the New England coast, and the Air Force Warning Area W-506, encompassing
the southern portions of Georges Bank.

Transportation--

There are four major ports in New England: Boston (Massachusetts),
Portland (Maine), New Haven (Connecticut), and Providence (Rhode Island).
Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs) and Precautionary Areas (PAs) have been
established by the U.S. Coast Guard and adopted by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) to reduce the possibility of collision between vessels
entering and exiting major port areas. Mariners are advised to exercise
extreme caution when crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, and when
navigating within precautionary areas. All TSSs and PAs are closer to
the coastline than to Georges Bank. The precautionary area in the Great
South Channel southwest of Georges Bank is closest to potential ODP drilling
activities.

Resource Development--

In addition to the fishery resources discussed above, the Georges
Bank area has substantial reserves of oil and gas. The Minerals Management
Service (1983c) estimated that conditional mean resource levels of 210
million barrels of oil and 4.9 trillion ft3 of gas may be present in the
outer continental shelf area offshore the North Atlantic states. Georges
Bank covers the major portion of this offshore area. The first lease sale
by the U.S. Department of the Interior in this area was held in 1979 and
resulted in 62 executed leases. Since then, two other lease sales have
been proposed but later postponed due to Congressional action. Eight explora-
tory wells were drilled on Georges Bank as a result of the first lease
sale, but commercial discoveries have not yet been made.

Other Scientific Research--

The controversy over oil and gas development in the Georges Bank area
has resulted in a number of scientific studies to assess the environmental
impacts of potential oil spills. For example, the Minerals Management
Service is sponsoring studies on the fate of drill muds and cuttings on
Georges Bank, the affects of these discharges on marine benthos, the effects
of oil on marine benthos, the effects of oil on marine mammals, physical
and biological processes of canyons and the continental slope in the North

143
and Mid-Atlantic OCS, physical oceanographic and geologic investigations,
and an environmental summary of the U.S. Atlantic continental rise.

Eastern Tropical Pacific

Eastern Pacific Rise--
  Commercial Fisheries--Commercial fishing in the international waters
of the East Pacific Rise representative region is conducted mainly by large
fishing fleets from the developed countries of the Pacific Rim.  In the
eastern central Pacific region, which consists largely of the Eastern Pacific
Rise area, the annual catch of fish (mainly tunas), crustaceans, molluscs,
and other species has increased steadily (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
1983). The annual catch increased from 1.5 million mt in 1976 to 2.6 million mt
in 1982, but still forms a very small part of the total world catch.

  Other Uses--The East Pacific Rise region is not among the heavily
travelled ocean routes in the world. Regularly scheduled military exercises
or scientific research are not carried out on the open seas.  Interest
in the seafloor mining of manganese nodules in this region is increasing.
However, only exploration has been conducted to date and no commercial
activities are planned for the near future. Since none of these activities
is expected to interfere with or be affected by the ODP, no further discussion
is provided.

Mid-American Trench--

  Commercial Fisheries--Commercial fishing is expanding in almost all
Central American countries bordering the Mid-American Trench representative
region (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
and Mexico). These fisheries earn foreign exchange and supply an important
component of the local diet. Waters offshore Central America support smaller
populations of numerous species rather than large schools of just a few
species. Shrimps, lobsters, croakers, albacore, skipjacks, and anchovies
are the most important commercial species.  In Guatemala, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, shrimp and lobster are the principal species caught for export.

  Most local fishermen operate within the 19-km (12-mi) territorial
limit. Fishing on the open seas is carried out mostly by international
companies.  Mexico claims a 322-km (200 mi) EEZ and reserves mineral and
marine resources within this zone to itself.  Foreign vessels may be licensed
to fish in the EEZ if Mexican citizens constitute at least half the crew.

  Other Uses--Coastal waters are used for transportation, military activi-
ties, and scientific research, but the level of such activities is low
due to general economic conditions in Central America. None of these activities
is expected to interfere with or be affected by the ODP, and no further
discussion is provided.

144
Section 3.4
FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
WHICH MAY BE IMPACTED BY ODP

Land use and air quality may be impacted by specific ODP activities.
Onshore tasks involve program planning and management, conversion of the
drilling vessel, design and fabrication of the drilling systems, and development
and use of land staging areas, particularly at TAMU.

Major U.S. sites of onshore activities include Washington D.C.; College
Station, Texas; Palisades, New York; and Pascagoula, Mississippi. JOI's
overall planning, management, operations, and data dissemination activities
are located in Washington, D.C. Direction of science and shipboard operations,
design and maintenance of permanent laboratories and support facilities,
and curation and dissemination of scientific information occur at TAMU.
This major university is located in College Station, a city of approximately
37,000 people in southwest Texas. Logging analysis and data dissemination
will occur in L-DGO's facility at Palisades, New York. L-DGO, TAMU, and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California will serve
as core repositories. Detailed procedures for offloading cores at ports,
transport to repositories, and curation are described in the Shipboard
Scientist Handbook (ODP 1985). Ship conversion, fabrication, and construction
of drilling systems and equipment occured in Pascagoula, Mississippi, a
port city of approximately 29,000 people. An industrial and fishing center,
Pascagoula is located on the Gulf of Mexico.

The drillship will visit various ports throughout the world between
operational legs for core transfer, fueling, routine maintenance, special
repairs, and stocking of consumables and materials. These established
ports have in-place facilities to accommodate calls by vessels like the
JOIDES RESOLUTION. Transportation of personnel and supplies to these various
locations will use existing carriers.

CHAPTER 4

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

146
Section 4.1
INTRODUCTION

Results of comparing the environmental impacts of the proposed action
with those of its alternatives are presented in this chapter. Environment
has been broadly defined to include physical, biological, social, legal,
and economic considerations. Both direct and secondary impacts have been
analyzed, whether positive or negative. Subjects are discussed at a level
of detail appropriate to the relative significance of each topic.

TREATMENT OF DRILLING LOCATIONS

As discussed in Chapter 2, the impact assessment focuses on four drilling
sites that represent the range of scientific goals, geographic locations,
and ecological conditions expected during of the ODP and that allow analysis
of the range of potential impacts. Subject categories that were reviewed
under each representative site in Chapter 3 are retained in this chapter
for impact analysis. Environmental conditions from all four sites are
considered in the determination of impacts on or to each subject category.
This allows assessment of potential impacts that may be ignored under a
more generalized approach.

TREATMENT OF ALTERNATIVES

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations state that
all reasonable alternatives to a proposed action must be "rigorously explored
and objectively evaluated." Such careful analyses occurred during the
OMDP period of planning and evaluation and throughout the subsequent development
of the AODP and transition to the ODP. Initially, alternatives external
to ocean drilling were discussed (that is, activities that could be implemented
in lieu of drilling to achieve some, but not all, of the objectives of
deep-sea scientific drilling). These options primarily involved extensive
geophysical surveys and/or other seismic studies. Continued CHALLENGER-
type drilling was also considered (in essence a continuation of the DSDP).
Impacts of these alternatives have been addressed in the DSDP/IPOD EIS
(NSF 1975), which is still applicable to the program. However, assessment
throughout program development indicated that only through an expanded
program of deep-sea drilling, which the ODP represents, could the important
objectives be realized. Other alternatives were judged inadequate for
meeting the objectives (Committee on Post-IPOD Science 1979; JOIDES 1981,
1982).

Alternative operational programs, which were mentioned in Chapter 2
of this EIS, are evaluated in this chapter. Internal programmatic alternatives
are appropriate to evaluate in the EIS. During program development, many
decisions were made to improve cost and technical efficiency. Decisions
lacking influence on environmental considerations do not receive detailed
discussion in this EIS. However, some aspects of the program do have bearing
on environmental considerations (e.g., operational decisions such as site

147
locations, well planning, drilling procedures, and drilling schedules).
These subjects are addressed with the necessary detail.  Many of these 
alternatives are still under evaluation.

148
Section 4.2
BASIC ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANALYSIS
OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

In this section, program elements are categorized by their site of 
potential influence (i.e., whether on land or at sea). Then, processes 
and procedures constituting the program elements are described in enough 
detail to support the discussions of impacts appearing later in the chapter.

ASPECTS OF ODP PRIMARILY AFFECTING THE TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT

The first years of effort in the ODP have taken place onshore, primarily 
for the tasks of program design, planning and management, conversion of   
the drilling vessel, and design and fabrication of the drilling systems.  
The primary impact of these activities was to create jobs.  For most of 
the activities, this was a temporary effect that ended with the commencement 
of at-sea operations. Land-based activities continuing throughout the 
program were discussed in Section 3.4.

Conversion of JOIDES RESOLUTION for ODP operations required shipyard 
construction work on the hull and superstructure.  The U.S. Department 
of Commerce, Maritime Administration discussed impacts of shipyard construction 
in the Final EIS on Title XI, Vessels Engaged in Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling 
Operations (MarAd 1975), which were applicable during conversion.  Similar 
impacts are expected from future conversion to riser drilling capability 
and are addressed in MarAd (1975).

ASPECTS OF ODP PRIMARILY AFFECTING THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT

Most potential impacts of the ODP will occur in the ocean, the site 
of most of the program activity.  These activities are described in this 
section. Assessments of impacts appear later in the chapter (Sections 4.4-4.6.)

Presence of the Ship and Drill String

Various materials are released to the environment during routine ship 
operations, whether in transit or drilling on station. During riserless 
drilling activities, the maximum length of time the ship would occupy a 
single location is limited to the duration of one sea leg (usually less 
than 60 days).  For any riser drill sites, this stay is lengthened by the 
time required to assemble the riser before drilling commences (typically 
3 weeks), and to achieve the deeper penetration of most riser holes.

The major discharges expected from riserless drilling activities are 
drilling fluids (seawater) and cuttings. These will be discharged to the 
seafloor, and will accumulate in the immediate vicinity of the hole.  Surface 
discharges are also expected, including sanitary and domestic wastes, desalina-
tion unit discharge, boiler blowdown, deck drainage, cooling water, uncontami-
nated ballast and bilge water, burn box waste, and excess cement slurry.

149
The volume of sanitary waste which consists of masserated hypochlorinated effluent is expected to reach 1,000 to 5,000 gallons per day (GPD). Dissolved oxygen depression resulting from this treated discharge is not expected to affect organisms when ambient dissolved oxygen concentrations are at least 6 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of surface waters in most of the world's oceans are generally much greater than 6 mg/L. Domestic wastes (shower and sink drainage) are not expected to produce a significant pollutant loading and will only raise particulate concentration temporarily in a localized area. Any drainage from the laboratories will have been acid neutralized in limestone media and milk of magnesia before addition to the domestic waste holding tank for eventual discharge.

Desalination units may discharge on the order of 20,000 GPD of seawater at a salinity twice that of ambient seawater. Boiler blowdown may be discharged once or twice per year and is not expected to be a significant source of pollutant loading.

Deck drainage consisting of rain and wash water from the deck and drilling floor is conveyed by gutters to a settling tank. Solids are separated before the water is discharged. Oil is the primary pollutant in deck drainage, but these discharges may also contain smaller concentrations of detergents.

Bilge and engine room drainage will be treated to remove oil prior to discharge. An International Maritime Consultive Organization (IMCO) rule requires all Liberian-registered ships to meet a 15 ppm oil concentration limit on these discharges by January 1, 1986. Noncontact cooling water discharge is not expected to be an important pollutant source. Except for the elevated temperature, the composition of noncontact cooling water will not differ significantly from ambient seawater. Ballast waters will not be treated.

All refuse and combustible waste material generated while at sea is burned in a high temperature burn box over the side of the vessel. After burning, the combusted burn box waste is discharged into the ocean. The discharge will not have any measurable dissolved oxygen demand and is not expected to produce significant pollutant loading. Particulate concentrations will be raised temporarily in a localized area.

Cement will also be discharged on the ocean floor during the early phases of drilling (i.e., during setting of surface casing), and during well abandonment and plugging. According to the ODP policy on well abandonment, when plugging is necessary, the hole should be cemented up to the first competent formation. This reduces the amount of cement introduced into the marine environment on the seafloor. Excess cement slurry resulting from equipment washdown after cementing operations will be discharged with deck drainage. The composition of the cement is not documented, but is not expected to be a significant pollutant source.

Release of Cuttings and Drilling Fluids

    Drilling procedures and equipment vary significantly between riserless and riser drilling, as discussed in Section 2.2. In addition, the composition of drilling fluids and the location of release are different for the two

150
drilling procedures. Therefore, environmemtal affects of drilling muds 
and cuttings are discussed separately for the two drilling procedures.

Riserless Drilling Operations--

Riserless drilling procedures used aboard CHALLENGER during the DSDP 
will also be used for the ODP. Surface seawater, used as the drilling 
fluid, is pumped through the drill string to the bottom of the hole.  This 
cools the bit and washes the cuttings up the annular space between the 
drill string and the wall of the drilled hole. At CHALLENGER's average 
pumping rate (350 gal/min) and operational time (agregate 150 days/year) 
75.3 million gal/year or 285,000 m3/year (372,780 yd3/year) of surface 
seawater were discharged at the seafloor. Minor amounts may invade sub-bottom 
formations. However, pump pressure sufficient to cause this would be avoided 
because of the deleterious effect on hole stability and the potential loss 
of the down-hole drill assembly and other subsea equipment.

If laden with drilling particulates (very fine cuttings), this sea 
water/solid suspension will spread laterally downcurrent.  Particulates 
will settle out and the fluid will mix with the local bottom water.  If 
generally particulate-free (as might be the case when pumping but not drilling 
or when drilling produces only very coarse cuttings that will not stay 
in suspension), the fluid will probably retain some coherence and buoyance, 
having been warmed while in the drill hole. The warmer, less-dense fluid 
will entrain ambient water on its rise through the deeper water masses. 
Eventually, this mixture will reach a level of neutral bouyancy, at which 
point it will spread laterally, mixing with the ambient waters.

Based on figures compiled during the DSDP, an average of 20,000 m/year 
(65,600 ft/year) of sediment and basalt will be penetrated.  Assuming a 
25-cm (10-in) diameter hole and about 30 percent hole enlargement, approximately 
1,350 m3/year (1,766 yd3/year) of drill hole cuttings will be produced 
and discharged at the seafloor, along with the drilling fluid. The maximum 
particle size that can be washed out at present pumping velocities is approxi-
mately 2 mm diameter. Particle-size distribution in the cuttings will vary 
with the material being drilled and the variety of bit. In soft sediments, 
the original particle size will dominate the size distribution of cuttings. 
Diamond bits, if used in consolidated sediments or solid rock, will produce 
finer cuttings than the more coarsely toothed roller bits.

Drilling muds are occassionally used to clean, spot, or lubricate the 
drill hole. For example, in preparation for logging and casing, 20-50 
bbl of drilling mud may be injected to remove coarse cuttings that the 
seawater drilling fluid did not remove [volume of 2.3-8 m3 (4.2-105 yd3) 
based on average mud weight of 17 lb/bbl and average water content of 50 
percent]. When the drill string is being pinched by a formation, 10-bbl 
[1.6 m3 (2.1-yd3)] shots may be used for lubrication. Estimated total 
usage of drilling mud is 3,000 m3/year (3,924 yd3/year), based on the DSDP 
mud use rates for similar riserless drilling. As with cuttings, muds will 
exit the hole at the seafloor. Areas of accumulation will depend on bottom 
currents.

151
Volumes of drilling muds and cuttings introduced into the environment 
at a single drill site can be estimated based on hole depth.  Assuming 
a penetration of 1,700 m (5,576 ft) (a worst-case scenario for riserless 
drilling based on the deepest penetration obtained during the DSDP), 115 
m3 (88 yd3) of cuttings and 255 m3 (195 yd3) of drilling muds will be discharged 
from the hole at the seafloor.  For purposes of impact analyses on benthic 
communities, solids deposited in even thicknesses of 1 cm and 1 mm would 
result in coverage of 0.04 km2 (0.01 mi2) and 37 km2 (14 mi2), respectively. 
This is equivalent to circles of 220 m (662 ft) and 6,900 m (22,632 ft) 
in diameter.  In reality, coverage is much less, with most of the deposition 
in the immediate vicinity of the borehole.  The coarser fraction will accumulate 
near the hole, while the finer fractions will accumulate progressively 
farther downcurrent.  The total area covered by cuttings will depend on 
bottom current velocities and the size distribution of cuttings.

Riser Drilling Operations--

Riser drilling procedures, materials, and equipment are similar to 
those used in offshore oil drilling.  Drilling mud instead of seawater 
is used as the drilling fluid.  The muds leave the drill bit nozzle, sustain 
the drill cuttings in suspension, and carry them to the drillship between 
the drill pipe and the walls of the bore hole, casing, and riser.  On board 
the ship, cuttings are separated from the muds by screening and washing 
techniques and then discharged at the sea surface.  Muds are returned to 
the mud tank for recirculation down the hole.  Drilling muds that are not 
separated from the drill cuttings are discharged with the cuttings to the 
ocean.

The volume of mud used per riser drilling site depends on water and 
hole depth.  The volume of mud discharged will vary from a few bbl to over 
1,000 bbl, depending on downhole formations and the condition and composition 
of the mud in use at the time.  For purposes of impact analyses, the worst-case 
situation would involve discharge of the four mud tanks on board JOIDES 
RESOLUTION, which combined hold 2,150 bbl.  This could occur if the reserve 
tanks were full and a mud change was necessary to meet conditions downhole 
or if the mud was beyond reconditioning.  This would result in the discharge 
of 342 m3 (447 yd3) of drilling mud to the surface waters over the drill site.

Although riser drilling holes are deeper, and more cuttings will be 
discharged per hole, fewer boreholes can be drilled per year.  The net 
effect will be to reduce the annual volume of cuttings discharged.  In 
addition, the cuttings will be released at the surface, resulting in greater 
dispersion and thinner initial accumulations on the seafloor.

Dilution of Drilling Mud Discharges--The Offshore Operations Committee 
(OOC) model has been used to estimate the dilution of drilling mud discharges 
from the JOIDES RESOLUTION.  A complete description of model formulations, 
concepts, required inputs, output options, and model limitations is given 
in the user's manual (Brandsma et al. 1983).  The OOC model was developed 
to describe the fate of offshore drilling mud discharges.  The model simulates 
the effluent plume (commonly known as the lower plume) through three phases: 
the jet phase (convective descent, dynamic collapse, and passive diffusion). 
The model also simulates an upper plume, which appears to form when particles

152
of mud separate from the main plume during the convective descent phase.
The upper plume may represent up to 10 percent of the discharged mud.

OOC model simulations for various oceanographic and drilling conditions
were conducted by Tetra Tech (Bigham et al. 1984). Results of these simulations
indicate that dilution increases with water depth. The case closest to
conditions that will be encountered during most ODP drilling is an open
ocean site characterized by a deep, well-mixed surface layer. Parameters
include a 120 m (394 ft) water depth, a 1,000 bbl/h mud discharge rate,
a 17.4 lb/gal mud bulk density, and a 10 cm/sec current speed. The shallower
depth of this case compared to ODP drill sites should conservatively represent
ODP conditions. Minimum particulate and dissolved dilutions at 100 m (328 ft)
from the discharge were calculated to be 1,440:1 and 2,500:1, respectively.
Similarly, at 300 m (984 ft) distance, the particulate and dissolved dilutions
were calculated to be 5,440:1 and 7,290:1, respectively. At 500 m (1,640 ft)
from the discharge, both particulate and dissolved fraction dilutions were
well over 10,000:1. Since lower discharge rates are more typical of offshore
drilling activity and higher current speeds may be encountered in the surface
waters of many proposed drilling sites, dilutions achieved during actual
ODP drilling should be much greater than those calculated.

Deposition of Drilling Discharges--Accumulation of drilling muds and
cuttings on the seafloor is expected to be minimal for discharges to water
depths as great as those of most sites to be drilled with a riser during
the ODP (several hundred meters minimum). No field studies and few modeling
efforts have been conducted at these depths to determine characteristics
of seafloor deposition.

The OOC model has been used to simulate drilling mud solids accumulation
in water depths from 5 to 750 m (16 to 2,460 ft) (Bigham et al. 1984; Conti-
nental Shelf Associates 1984). While the majority of these simulations
were run for shallow water conditions, the results indicate that minimal
seafloor solids accumulation (much less than 0.1 mm) occurs for depths
greater than 100 m (328 ft) and that accumulation decreases as water depth
or current increases.

Simulations conducted by Continental Shelf Associates (1984) represented
typical drilling and oceanographic conditions offshore southern California.
Current speed, density stratification, bulk mud density, and water depth
were varied to determine deposition patterns under various conditions.
Four water depths greater than 100 m (328 ft) were considered in this analysis:
190 m (623 ft), 200 m (656 ft), 480 m (1,574 ft), and 750 m (2,460 ft).
The maximum drilling mud deposition thickness calculated for these cases
[190 m (623 ft) depth, 480 bbl discharge] was 0.01 mm. The bottom area
affected by deposition greater than 0.001 mm was calculated to be 0.43 km2
(0.17 mi2) for this case. Even a worst-case discharge (2,150 bbl) should
result in maximum accumulations of less than 0.05 mm. Cuttings deposition
was simulated for the 480 m (1,574 ft) depth case only (480 bbl of cuttings).
The maximum deposition thickness for this case was calculated to be 0.007
mm. The bottom area affected by cuttings deposition greater than 0.001
mm was calculated to be 107 km2 (41 mi2). Cuttings volumes in the simulation
are on the order of those expected discharged from a deep hole.

Composition of Drilling Mud--

Drilling muds are complex mixtures of clays, barite, and several specialty 
additives used primarily to remove rock particles from the hole created 
by the drill bit.  The composition of drilling mud can vary over a wide 
range from one hole to the next, as well as with depth during the drilling 
of a single hole.

Drilling muds serve several other functions in addition to removing 
solids. These include creating back pressure to counteract formation pressure 
at depth, lubricating the drill bit, and controlling the flow of fluids 
between the formation and the hole.  As the hole becomes deeper and encounters 
different formations, the type of mud may need to be changed or the composition 
altered.

Eight generic mud types were evaluated by the U.S. EPA during discharge 
permit development for drilling muds and cuttings in offshore drilling.  
Basic components of each mud and their maximum authorized concentrations 
are listed in Table 20.  These guidelines will be followed by the ODP.  
Each mud differs in its basic components, and a single mud type can vary 
substantially in composition. For example, the amount of barite in sea-
water/lignosulfonate mud can vary from 25 to 450 lb/bbl.

The presence of potentially toxic trace elements in drilling muds 
and cuttings is of primary concern.  Metals including lead, zinc, mercury, 
arsenic, and cadmium can be present as impurities in barite; chromium is 
present in chrome lignosulfonates and chrome-treated lignite (Crippen et 
al. 1980; Kramer et al. 1980).  Drill pipe dope (15 percent copper, 7 percent 
lead) and drill collar dope (35 percent zinc, 20 percent lead, 7 percent 
copper) may also contribute trace metals to the muds and cuttings discharge 
(Ayers et al. 1980; Ecomar 1978).

An estimate of trace metal concentrations in the drilling muds and 
cuttings discharged from ODP drilling operations is made here for subsequent 
impact evaluation.  Because only limited data are available on the trace 
metal content of drilling muds and cuttings, maximum values for generic 
muds (Table 20) were used and supplemented by the values reported by Northern 
Technical Services (1981, 1982) and Crippen et al. (1980) to produce the 
expected trace metal concentration values presented in Table 21.

In the absence of detailed information on the partitioning of metals 
between the dissolved and particulate phases of drilling muds and cuttings, 
the metals partitioning characteristics of dredged material are used here 
to estimate dissolved metals concentrations associated with drilling muds 
and cuttings.  This is believed to be a reasonable approach because of 
the physical similarities of the two materials.  Dredged materials are 
naturally-occurring sediments, sometimes contaminated, that are mechanically 
or hydraulically picked up and transported to another site for disposal.  
The important similarity to drilling muds and cuttings is that the majority 
of the bulk metals are incorporated into the crystalline lattice of inorganic 
particles.

of samples of dredged material dumped at sea in 1978 and 1979 (Bigham et 
al.

50 separate analyses of sediments from the east and Gulf coasts of the
U.S. The data in Table 22 indicate that the partitioning varies from one
metal to the next but, in general, the dissolved fraction in mg/L is approxi-
mately 0.1 percent of the solid fraction in mg/kg.

Potential Oil and Gas Spills and Blowouts

Safety procedures and mitigating measures to reduce encounters with
hydrocarbon reserves and prevent their release into the environment are
discussed in Section 4.8. While the probability of an oil spill or an
oil or gas blowout is very low, it is not zero. Impacts associated with
these events are discussed under Mishaps and Accidents (Section 4.7).

Transportation of Supplies and Personnel

The drillship and its operation require supply of consumables and
materials. Additionally, replacement of crew members and scientific personnel
is involved. Supplies and personnel are transported by existing carriers
to the various ports of call throughout the world. Occasionally, transport
of supplies and personnel from shore-based facilities to the ship while
at sea is accomplished by helicopter and other support vessels.

Noise from Drillship and Drilling Operations

Noise from ODP operations are generated by operation of the vessel,
drilling rig, dynamic positioning system, helicopter, other support vessels
and seismic geophysical surveying. Primary sources are machinery noise
and diesel engines. Shipboard personnel are required to wear hearing protection
devices where appropriate. Attenuation of airborne sound under light wind
conditions and calm seas would reduce noise from normal drilling operations
to below ambient levels after 3.2 km (2 mi). Under higher sea states,
attenuation would occur within less distance (Minerals Management Service
1983a). Noise impacts to terrestrial areas are not expected, due to the
distance of drill sites from land. However, sound waves travel underwater
for far greater distances than they travel in air. Under the right conditions,
noise from drilling operations can be elevated above ambient conditions
for over 100 km (62 mi) from the drill site (Gales 1982). Impacts on the
acoustical environment are detailed in Section 4.4.

Section 4.3
IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE ODP

The environment will exert considerable influence on several aspects
of the ODP, particularly in the areas of design and field operations (Table
23). Principal components of the environment that are addressed in this
discussion include weather, ice, sea conditions, and geological conditions.
The relevance of each of these topics will be discussed in turn. The discus-
sions will overlap because many of these environmental features are interrelated
and therefore tend to have cumulative effects.

WEATHER

Familiarity with climate of an area and some predictive ability are
essential to:

-   Ensure the vessel is capable of operating in conditions
    that are normal to each drill site and can safely withstand
    occasional extreme conditions

-   Ensure adequate design of the riser and drill string systems
    to withstand the forces translated to the water column from
    the atmosphere

-   Schedule the drill sites to avoid period of likely extreme
    conditions

-   Determine prevailing working conditions on board the ship
    so that personnel may be outfitted and trained adequately
    to ensure peak safety and efficiency

-   Develop drilling procedures that respond adequately to the
    prevailing weather and develop emergency procedures for
    extreme conditions.

Winds are the most significant weather condition affecting the program.
Winds in the general location of a proposed drill site are important for
two reasons. First, they can force the drillship off station and damage
the drilling system, or, if sufficiently strong, can force abandonment
of the drilling operation. Second, winds act upon the surface of the ocean,
generating waves, swell, and surface currents that can impede or endanger
operations. JOIDES RESOLUTION is designed to keep station and drill in
winds up to 45 kn; swells up to 8 m (26 ft), and currents up to 2.5 kn.

On-site weather data are essential during operations. Sufficient
advance warning of approaching weather systems is necessary to permit operations
to be modified or curtailed and the ship secured. Accordingly, weather
will be monitored on board the ship with a full-time meteorologist and
state-of-the-art instrumentation staffed by the ODP.

ICE

Sea ice at some of the drilling locations will impact the program.
JOIDES RESOLUTION was designed and constructed for work in cold weather
and is capable of operating in air temperatures as low as -18°C and sea
temperatures as low as -2°C. However, drilling in the high latitudes,
where sea conditions can be extreme and air temperatures are commonly below
freezing, increases the possibility that ice build-up on the vessel super-
structure will affect vessel stability.

Operations may also be impacted by the presence of ice in the water,
perhaps resulting in standby or drive-off conditions. JOIDES RESOLUTION
is ice-strengthened to a rating of ABS Ice Class 1B for "navigation in
medium ice conditions". However, there are no plans to continue site operations
when an immediate threat of contact with icebergs or pack ice exists.
While the ship has the capability to transit through pack ice, it cannot
drill under any ice-flow conditions because of station-keeping difficulties.

SEA CONDITIONS

Sea conditions, represented primarily by waves and currents, are largely
a product of meteorological conditions occurring over a broad area. This
is especially true of waves, which are caused by the interaction between
wind and the water surface. Currents are the product of winds and a variety
of other forces acting on the column of water (e.g., gravity, tides, surface
pressure, and differences in seawater density.)

Sea conditions will have an important impact on design and implementation
of the ODP. Waves and currents exert a direct influence on vessel motion
through forces directed against the ship and the riser or drill string.
These forces affect the ship's position relative to the well bore and neces-
sitate a dynamic positioning system capable of compensating for prevailing
conditions. In addition, waves will impact working conditions on board
the ship. If the sea is sufficiently rough, work will be suspended.

Data on the ranges of magnitude, direction, and duration of surface
and subsurface currents at potential drill sites were necessary to design
the drill string and riser system. Waves, currents, buoyancy, and gravity
all contribute to the total forces acting on the drill string or riser.
Data on surface currents are particularly important because the forces
of concern are those imposed on the union between the ship hull and drill
string. Lift and drag forces may be significant for extremely long drill
strings in a current flow. The drill string and load-handling equipment
on JOIDES RESOLUTION have been redesigned to handle extreme conditions.

Physical features such as strong internal waves and turbidity currents
may also impact drilling operations. Little is known of the forces that
could be generated by either of these physical phenomena so it is difficult
to account for them in the design of the drilling systems. The likelihood
of these phenomena affecting drilling is thought to be low, given the low
frequency of observation.

161
GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS

General geology of the representative drill sites was described in
Chapter 3. Geological conditions of the formations to be drilled influence
the program, primarily in site selection and well planning. Data gathering
will continue during drilling operations through use of downhole logging
with in situ measuring devices and coring, which permit real-time analysis
of the formations being drilled. Site-specific information is essential
in planning to maximize data recovery and minimize operation risks. As
indicated earlier, sites must be located away from geological structures
where significant amounts of hydrocarbons are possible or where other geological
hazards and safety problems may occur. Strict procedures followed by the
ODP during the site selection process are reviewed in detail in Section 4.8.

The ODP will engage in several data-gathering activities. Seismic
surveys will be conducted before drilling to provide data on formation
dip and strike, slumping, faulting, bright spots (which may indicate abnormal
pressures), stratigraphy, and other aspects of the geology. This information
will be confined mainly to the upper few kilometers.

Data collection will continue during drilling, primarily through downhole
logging and coring. Logging activities which consist of electrical surveys
run in the hole and through the drill string or casing, will provide data
on thickness and sequence of formations penetrated, porosity, fluid content,
pore pressure, natural and induced radioactivity, electrical conductivity,
and sound wave conductivity. In most coring activities, a hydraulic piston
core developed during the DSDP will be used to retrieve relatively undisturbed
cores from below the drill bit in the top 100 m (328 ft) of unconsolidated
sediment. Normal drilling activities utilizing a rotary coring system
will be used during the remainder of the drilling. This will allow visual
confirmation of formations being drilled and analyses for hydrocarbon or
hydrogen sulfide accumulations. Mudlogging during riser drilling can provide
additional geological information. In some cases, mudlogging can yield
data on hydrocarbon analysis and lithology before cores can be brought
to the surface.

Ambient temperature of the sediments will also affect drilling procedures.
At the depths and latitudes to be drilled, the ambient water temperature
can reach -1o C. Temperatures at the bottom of the hole typically reach
120o C or greater, and returning seawater drilling fluid or drilling mud
may reach 80o C upon circulating up to the seafloor. Subsea equipment
and drilling mud must therefore operate over a wide temperature range:
-1 to 80o C. The bit and lower drill string must operate over an even
wider range:  -1 to 120o C. Riserless drilling will also occur in hydro-
thermally active regions near active spreading centers, where downhole
temperatures may reach 300o C or higher.

Geological features in the vicinity of the drill sites could result
in the decision not to drill, cause early abandonment, or lead to damage
and/or loss of subsea equipment. Geological constraints and hazards that
could impact the ODP include:

162
- Deep or shallow faulting and related seismicity
- Mass movements of sediments (i.e., slides and slumps)
- Gasified sediments

These features and processes are normal in the marine environment and are considered here for their impact on the ODP. Other geologic features and processes that could result in the release of substances into the marine environment are discussed in Section 4.7.

Faulting generally indicates present or historic seismic activity. Shallow faults indicate the potential for movement due to either gravitational forces or to seismic activity. Deep faults overlain by recent unfaulted sediments indicate the potential for reactivation. In all cases, movement will affect sediment stability and could result in loss of the hole and damage or loss of the drill string and subsea equipment. In addition, fault planes can act as conduits for deeper hydrocarbons or high pressure gas that could result in a blowout. Both shallow and deep faults are detectable with modern geophysical techniques.

Mass movements of sediments can be induced in a number of ways, including:
- Cyclic loading by storm waves or breaking internal waves
- Dynamic loading by ground acceleration during earthquakes
- Overloading by deposition
- Oversteepening by erosion (Aaron et al. 1980).

Without shear strength analysis from actual cores, it is difficult to predict if a slope will fail and cause a slump or slide. However, seismic surveys can determine if slumps or slides have previously taken place.

Gasified sediments can occur in unconsolidated surface sedimentary layers where in situ biogenic gas forms. Under certain load-bearing capacities and given sufficient amounts of gas with associated critical values of solubility and sediment characteristics, spontaneous liquefaction of gasified sediments may occur (Minerals Management Service 1983c). This loss of sediment stability can result in the loss of the hole and damage or loss of the drill string and subsea equipment. Gas-charged sediments can be identified by analysis of surface cores or by acoustically turbid zones or "wash outs" on high-resolution seismic records.

Each geologic feature indicating these hazards can be detected with the modern seismic profiling methods required by the ODP. Since the standard ODP site selection process eliminates locations that indicate potential occurrence of these features from further consideration, it is unlikely that geologic hazards will be encountered during the ODP.

Section 4.4
IMPACT OF THE ODP ON THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

IMPACT ON LAND

Conversion of the ship, and fabrication and construction of drilling
systems and equipment were performed on land areas. Because these activities
took place in existing shipyards, additional land resources were not depleted.
Waste disposal activities were conducted in accordance with applicable
regulations and no significant impact occurred.

IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY

Onshore conversion of the ship, and fabrication and construction of
drilling systems and equipment generated fugitive dust. Insignificant
quantities were added to the ambient air, because the quantity of emissions
involved was small and many of the activities were done indoors.

Through fuel consumption, operation of the drilling ship, airplanes,
and helicopters will locally increase emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur
oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter emission.
Use of the burn box will also release carbon monoxide and particulate matter.
Solvents used in the laboratories are collected by hoods and vented to
the air at very low concentrations. There will be a temporary, minor impact
on local ambient air quality during these operations.

IMPACT ON WATER QUALITY

Water quality in the vicinity of ODP drilling activities may be impacted
by a wide range of waste discharges related to the drilling process, equipment
maintenance, and personnel housing. Discharges include drilling muds and
cuttings, sanitary and domestic wastes, desalination unit discharges, boiler
blowdown, deck drainage, cooling water, uncontaminated ballast and bilge
water, burn box wastes, and excess cement slurry. As described in Section
4.2 of this document, the discharge of sanitary and domestic wastes, desali-
nation unit wastes, deck drainage, bilge and ballast waters, and excess
cement slurry will not significantly impact water quality due to the low
volume and low pollutant loading of these wastes.

The major discharges expected from riserless drilling activities are
those of surface seawater (drilling fluid), drilling mud, and cuttings
at the seafloor. Discharges at the ocean floor are discussed in Section
4.2. The quality of bottom water would be impacted by localized, slight
increases in temperature, oxygen, nutrients, dissolved gases from the atmo-
sphere, and suspended particulates. Coarser drill cuttings will accumulate
in the immediate vicinity of the borehole. No increase in suspended par-
ticulates in the water column is expected.

The major discharges expected from riser drilling activities are those
of drilling mud and cuttings to surface waters. The components of typical
drilling mud and the expected dilutions with distance from the discharge
are discussed in Section 4.2. Although no studies have addressed dilution

164
of drill cuttings in the water column directly, these materials are expected 
to act similar to the particulate fraction of the drilling mud.

Impact on water quality from drilling mud and cuttings discharges 
is expected to be limited to the immediate vicinity of the discharge. 
Maximum expected trace metals concentrations in the dissolved fraction 
of the drilling mud, the U.S. Federal marine water quality criteria, and 
typical seawater concentrations (background) for specific metals of concern 
are summarized in Table 2.4. Using these values, a maximum dilution of 
only 8:1 is needed to comply with Federal criteria, and of approximately 
11,000:1 to approach background metals concentrations.  As discussed in 
Section 4.2, predicted minimum drilling mud dilutions (dissolved fraction) 
of approximately 2,500:1 and 11,000:1 are reached within 100 and 500 m 
(328 and 1,640 ft) respectively. Not only are Federal criteria for metals 
met well within 100 m (328 ft) of the drillship, but background levels 
are approached within 500 m (1,640 ft). Therefore, negligible water quality 
impacts from dissolved drilling mud components are expected outside of 
a 100-m (328-ft) radius from the drillship.

Drilling mud discharges will cause increases in receiving water suspended 
solids concentrations. Using the particulate dilutions discussed in Section 
4.2, estimated suspended solids concentrations at 100 and 500 m (328 and 
1,640 ft) from the discharge are 1,000 mg/L and 110 mg/L, respectively. 
These results indicate that there will be substantial increases in receiving 
water turbidity within 500 m (1,640 ft) of the discharge. However, the 
suspended solids concentration within the plume decreases very rapidly 
with distance. Based on this trend, background suspended solids concentrations 
(less than 10 mg/L) should be approached within approximately 1,000 m (3,280 
ft) of the discharge. Impacts associated with temporarily increased turbidity 
are negligible outside a 1,000-m (3,280-ft) radius from the drillship.

IMPACT ON THE SEA BOTTOM

The seafloor will be impacted by the deposition of drilling mud and 
cuttings, surface casing and reentry cone assemblies, and dynamic positioning 
beacons. Metal components will deteriorate eventually, mainly to hydrated 
oxides. Impacts from these structures or their breakdown products will be 
minor.

  Accumulations of drilling mud and cuttings are discussed in Section 
4.2. For riserless drilling, worst-case accumulations of 255 m^(3) (195 yd^(3)) 
in the immediate vicinity of the borehole were estimated. This would cover 
a circle of diameter 220 m (662 ft) to the depth of 1 cm. Impacts would 
include local alteration of sediment characteristics and modification of 
bottom topography. Deposition from surface discharges of drilling mud 
and cuttings from riser drilling is expected to be minimal at the depths 
of most sites to be drilled during the ODP. While area of impact will 
be increased by dispersion in the water column, maximum accumulations should 
be less than 0.02 mm. Negligible impacts to the sea bottom should occur 
from these accumulations during the riser drilling phase.

IMPACT ON THE ACOUSTICAL ENVIRONMENT

ODP operations produce noise above ambient levels in the ocean.  Underwater 
noise levels may be elevated over ambient as far as 160 km (100 mi) under 
certain conditions (Gales 1982).  Noise levels are significantly greater 
when the vessel is underway than when drilling.  Most of this noise is 
produced by propeller cavitation (Ross 1981), although at lower speeds 
this falls below noise levels from propulsion machinery (Brown 1982).  
Noise measurements of JOIDES RESOLUTION or other dynamically positioned 
drillships underway or while drilling apparently have not been made.  Ships 
of similar size produce various tones while in transit of 170 to 200 dB 
between 10 and 150 Hz, with levels falling off at the higher frequencies 
(Buck and Chalfant 1972; Ross 1981; Brown 1982).  Dominant tones produced 
from drilling operations on various drillships and semi-submersibles ranged 
from 130 to 160 dB over a larger bandwidth of 10 to 250 Hz (Buerkle 1975; 
Gales 1982; Greene 1982; Turl 1982; and Stewert et al. 1983).  Dynamic 
positioning by thrusters could significantly raise noise levels while drilling. 
Echo sounding equipment used in dynamic positioning produces tones slightly 
elevated over ambient levels at 3.5 and 12 kHz.

Other significant sources of noise generated during ODP operations 
result from use of the heliport on the fantail of the ship and seismic 
surveying.  Dominant tone levels of about 150 dB at 22 Hz have been measured 
below the surface from helicopters (Greene 1982).  Noise will only be detectable 
under water for about 16 to 26 sec during helicopter flyover.  Seismic 
surveys can produce the most intense noise levels with dominant tones of 
220 to 250 dB over a large bandwidth.  However, most are at lower frequencies 
(Johnston and Cain 1981).  Levels have been recorded between 115 and 153 
dB for frequencies around 150 Hz at distances ranging between 8 and 28.7 
km (5 and 17.8 mi) (Greene 1982).  Seismic profiling from JOIDES RESOLUTION 
is run with a single channel system employing a 80 in3 water gun and a 
400 in3 air gun which should produce lower noise levels.

Ambient noise levels in the ocean seldom exceed 80 dB in the frequency 
range that most ODP related noise is produced (see Figure 18).  Noise in 
the vicinity of operations will be significantly elevated, similar to any 
region that has moderate ocean vessel traffic.  Seismic profiling is only 
run on one line starting 16 to 19 km (10 to 12 mi) from the drill site 
until reaching station resulting in a short-term significant increase in 
noise over ambient levels.  Noise levels will not be raised significantly 
at any terrestrial areas from ODP operations, resulting in negligible impact 
to the terrestrial acoustical environment.

Section 4.5
IMPACT OF THE ODP ON THE BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT

IMPACT ON PHYTOPLANKTON AND ZOOPLANKTON

Presence of Drillship

Surface discharges from the ship will include sanitary and domestic wastes, desalination unit discharges, boiler blowdown, deck drainage, cooling water, uncontaminated ballast and bilge water, burn box waste, and excess cement slurry.

The largest volume of ship discharge will be high-salinity water from the desalination unit, up to 20,000 gallons per day (GPD).  It will not contain appreciable quantities of organic materials, metals, or toxic substances, and will be diluted rapidly in the water column.  Because of their innocuous nature and rapid dilution by ambient seawater, discharges from the desalination unit are expected to have negligible impacts on phytoplankton and zooplankton.

Sanitary and domestic wastes will be discharged at a rate of 1,000 to 5,000 GPD.  Nutrients introduced into the water column by these wastes may enhance phytoplankton growth.  However, because of the small volumes of sewage effluent, rapid dilution in the receiving waters, and dispersion of the waste field by currents, impacts are expected to be negligible.

The suspended solids portion of the sewage and domestic waste discharges may affect zooplankton populations by interfering with feeding or respiratory activities.  However, such impacts are expected to be negligible because of the short periods of time during which zooplankters will be exposed to the wastes.  It is expected that the sewage and domestic wastes will be diluted and dispersed rapidly in the water column.  The rapid dilution and dispersion of sewage and domestic wastes should also preclude indirect effects on zooplankton populations through alteration of phytoplankton communities, as there will be insufficient time for phytoplankton community changes to occur.  Finally, as was discussed earlier in Section 4.2, dissolved oxygen depression resulting from the discharge of sewage and domestic wastes is not expected to affect marine organisms, including zooplankton.

The remaining surface discharges (i.e., boiler blowdown, deck drainage, cooling water, uncontaminated ballast and bilge water, burn box waste, and excess cement slurry) are considered innocuous, or are discharged only occasionally and in small volumes.  They should be diluted rapidly in the water column, and dispersed quickly by surface currents.  Impacts from these discharges are also expected to be negligible.

Riserless Drilling Operations

Riserless drilling operations will result in the discharge of seawater, cuttings, and some drilling muds on the seafloor.  Because drilling muds and cuttings will not be discharged into the water column, no impacts on

168
phytoplankton or zooplankton populations are expected as a result of drilling 
operations themselves.

Riser Drilling Operations

Riser drilling operations may generate impacts due to the presence 
of the drillship, and the surface discharge of drilling muds and cuttings. 
Possible impacts of surface discharges of drilling muds and cuttings on 
phytoplankton include:

- Decreased primary production and/or increased mortality 
due to acute or sublethal toxic effects of trace metals

- Decreased primary production due to light reduction and 
increased turbidity

- Stimulation of primary production by trace nutrients in 
the discharge.

Since phytoplankton species exhibit differential sensitivities to light, 
nutrients, and toxic materials, any or a combination of these effects could 
cause changes in relative species abundance, diversity, and species composition.

Of the three possible impacts listed above, the toxic effects of metals 
are of greatest concern because of the potential for metals to bioaccumulate 
within organisms and to biomagnify within the ecosystem. Few bioassay 
data are available concerning the effects of drilling muds on phytoplankton 
(see Petrazzuolo 1983). However, several factors suggest that the discharge 
of drilling muds and cuttings will have little (if any) impact on phyto-
plankton. First, suspended solids and dissolved particulate metals will 
be diluted rapidly to background levels, usually within 100 to 1,000 m 
(328 to 3,281 ft) downcurrent of drilling mud discharges (Neff 1981; Duke 
and Parrish 1984). Second, residence times of suspended solids and toxic 
materials in the water column are expected to be short. Drilling muds, 
will be discharged briefly and intermittently. It is unlikely that pelagic 
organisms in the vicinity of the mud discharge would be exposed continuously 
to high concentrations of drilling fluids for long periods of time. Third, 
most metals in the discharge will not be available for uptake by organisms 
because they are bound to particulates in the mud itself. Lastly, if the 
mud and cuttings discharges affect phytoplankton populations that contact 
the plume, mixing of impacted phytoplankton with adjacent unaffected popu-
lations, should occur rapidly and promote recovery of the impacted populations.

Possible impacts of surface discharges of drilling muds and cuttings 
on zooplankton include:

- Decreased growth, altered behavior, and/or increased mortality 
due to acute or chronic effects of toxic materials in drilling 
muds

- Interference with feeding or respiratory activities due 
to increased suspended solids concentrations

169
-   Indirect enhancement or inhibition of zooplankton populations
    resulting from impacts on phytoplankton.

Since zooplankton species exhibit differential sensitivities to toxic materials,
suspended solids, and altered phytoplankton communities, any or a combination
of these effects could cause changes in species composition and abundance.

Of the three possible impacts listed above, the toxic effects of metals
are of greatest concern because of the potential for metals to bioaccumulate
within organisms and to biomagnify within the ecosystem. Bioassay data
concerning the effects of drilling muds on zooplankton are limited. Available
data indicate that crustacean larvae are relatively more sensitive to mud/water
mixtures than other species tested (Carls and Rice 1984). This sensitivity
may be due to an inability to tolerate high concentrations of suspended
particles rather than to toxicants in the drilling fluids (Neff 1981).
The single species of copepod that has been tested was also found to be
relatively sensitive to drilling muds (see Petrazzuolo 1983). Results
of tests on phytoplankton and zooplankton using drilling muds and cuttings
represent the sum of the additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects
of individual pollutants on the species tested. At present, these additive,
synergistic, and antagonistic interactions are poorly understood.

Although some zooplankters appear to be sensitive to discharges of
drilling muds and cuttings, little or no impact on zooplankton is expected
under field conditions. The reasons for this are the same as those discussed
above for phytoplankton populations: 1) suspended solids and dissolved
particulate metals will be diluted rapidly to background levels; 2) the
residence times of suspended solids and toxic materials in the water column
are expected to be short; 3) drilling muds will be discharged briefly and
intermittently, precluding continuous, long-term exposure to high concentrations
of muds and cuttings; and 4) impacted populations will be mixed rapidly
with adjacent unaffected populations, promoting rapid recovery.

IMPACT ON NEKTON

Presence of Drillship--

As was discussed above, ship discharges are expected to be innocuous,
rapidly diluted in the water column, and dispersed quickly by surface currents.
Rapid dilution and dispersion should minimize contact, and hence impacts,
to nektonic organisms. Moreover, nektonic organisms will be able to avoid
the discharge plumes, further minimizing contact with the discharged materials.

Riserless Drilling Operations

Because seawater, cuttings, and drilling muds will be discharged on
the sediment surface, pelagic nektonic organisms (i.e., fishes, squids,
and other motile forms) should not be exposed to these discharges. Demersal
nektonic organisms may be exposed to these discharges, however, since they
live in close association with the sediment-water interface and often consume
benthic organisms. The area affected by the discharge will vary with the
volume of the discharge, the discharge rate, and the current velocity at
the sediment-water interface. Persistence of the discharge pile will depend
on its composition, periodic storms (at continental shelf depths), and

170
current velocities (at all depths). Potential impacts to demersal nektonic 
organisms include the smothering of demersal eggs, acute and chronic toxicity, 
bioaccumulation, and indirect effects through food supply reduction.

Smothering of Demersal Eggs--

Demersal eggs of a number of species could be smothered or otherwise 
affected if a discharge coincides with spawning or the presence of eggs 
on the bottom.  Eggs of fishes (and invertebrates) require oxygen exchange 
across the egg membrane and may require exchanges of metabolites, salts, 
and nutrients.  Little is known of the sensitivities of the eggs of most 
fish species to burial. The potential for smothering would be greatest 
in continental shelf and upper continental slope areas, particularly in 
areas where spawning is known to occur (e.g., Georges Bank).  If one assumes 
that demersal eggs would be smothered when the thickness of deposited muds 
and cuttings exceeds 1 cm (0.4 in), then the worst-case analysis presented 
in Section 4.2 indicates that demersal eggs would be smothered over an 
area of 0.4 km2 (0.15 mi).  This area is equivalent to a circle 220 m (722 
ft) in diameter.

Acute and Chronic Toxicity--

Whereas drill cuttings are largely inert, drilling muds often contain 
metals and other potentially toxic substances.  Metals content of drilling 
muds can vary considerably.  However, the following five components constitute 
at least 90 percent of the substances in most water-based drilling muds: 
barite, bentonite, lignite, chrome lignosulfonate, and sodium hydroxide. 
The most toxic of these components are the chrome and ferrochrome ligno-
sulfonates, which are "moderately toxic" to all but the most sensitive 
species and life stages (National Research Council 1983).  Typical 96-hour 
LC50 values for these substances are 100-1,000 ppm.  Other metals of concern 
are barium, cadmium, copper, iron, mercury, lead, and zinc (Neff 1981).

Acute toxicities of a variety of drilling muds have been determined 
for a number of fish species (see Neff 1981; National Research Council 
1983; Petrazzuolo 1983; Duke and Parrish 1984).  With few exceptions, acute 
toxicities of drilling muds to fish species were low.  That is, 96-hour 
LC50 values exceeded 10,000 ppm of drilling mud added (Neff 1981).  For 
those few species that were relatively intolerant of drilling muds, test 
results often suggested that damage was caused by abrasion or clogging 
of respiratory surfaces by particulates rather than by chemical toxicity 
of the mud.  Larval and juvenile fishes may be more sensitive to drilling 
muds than are adult fishes, as is generally true of invertebrate species. 
A study using embryos of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus documented 
retarded development at mud concentrations of 1,000 ppm (see Neff 1981). 
However, the available data are insufficient to fully evaluate this hypothesis.

Sublethal effects of drilling muds and cuttings have received little 
study.  Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether such impacts 
would occur at lower concentrations of muds and cuttings than those at 
which acute toxicities have been documented.

Demersal species (i.e., primarily demersal fishes) may be in contact 
with drilling muds and cuttings on the seafloor during and after the period

171
of discharges.  The potential for contact will remain until the mud and 
cuttings are thoroughly dispersed.  Because drilling muds and cuttings 
apparently have a low toxicity potential for most fishes, and because fishes 
may actively avoid the discharged materials, acute and chronic impacts 
to demersal fishes should be negligible.  Moreover, if such impacts occur, 
they should be very localized, occurring only where the muds and cuttings 
are not yet dispersed.

Bioaccumulation--

Lead, mercury, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and barium are the 
primary constituents of drilling muds with potential for bioaccumulation. 
The presence or absence and concentrations of each metal will vary with 
the specific type of drilling mud and the quantities used.  Most of these 
metals will be associated with solids.  However, reducing conditions in 
the sedimentary environment could release some bound forms into the interstitial 
water or overlaying water column.

Fish can bioaccumulate metals by direct absorption from the water 
or by ingestion of contaminated food.  Because of the low concentrations 
of metals in dissolved form, the small area of the bottom affected, and 
the mobility of fish, it is unlikely that direct absorption will be an 
important pathway for the bioaccumulation of metals.

Benthic invertebrates in the vicinity of the discharge, or benthic 
organisms that later settle on discharged materials, may bioaccumulate 
metals (discussed below in Impact on Benthos).  By consuming these organisms, 
fish may also bioaccumulate the metals.  When the metals ingestion rate 
exceeds the metals excretion rate in a given fish, biomagnification occurs.

At present, insufficient information is available to:
-   Predict the degree to which benthic organisms will bioaccumulate 
    metals
-   Predict the degree to which fish will consume benthic organisms 
    containing metals, accumulate those metals in their tissues
-   Predict the amount of contact a fish will have with discharged 
    materials.

However, the bioaccumulation of metals in demersal fish tissues should 
be negligible because of the limited area of bottom over which muds and 
cuttings would be deposited and the mobility of fish.

Indirect Effects through Food Supply Reduction--

The disposal of drilling muds and cuttings may indirectly affect demersal 
fish populations by causing changes in benthic communities upon which they 
feed.  Benthic communities may be affected by smothering, changes in substrate 
characteristics, and alterations in the recruitment patterns of larval 
forms (discussed below in the Impacts to Benthos).  The areal extent and 
magnitude of such impacts to benthic communities will depend on the volume 
of discharged muds and cuttings, the dispersion of those materials by storms

172
and currents, and the sensitivity of the benthic community to changes in
the benthic habitat. Impacts to demersal fishes because of reduced benthic
prey populations should be negligible because the area of impact will be
extremely small compared with the total benthic resources available to
fish populations within a given ecosystem.  If one assumes that benthic
communities will be smothered in areas where muds and cuttings exceed 1
cm (0.4 in) depth of accumulation (see "Impacts on Benthos" below), the
area over which prey organism abundances would be reduced would be 0.4
km2 (0.15 mi2). This area is equivalent to a circle 200 m (722 ft) in
diameter. Benthic conditions should return to a "normal" state as the
muds and cuttings are dispersed through time.

Riser Drilling Operations

    Because riser drilling operations discharge muds and cuttings at the
surface, these materials may impact both pelagic and demersal nektonic
forms. Pelagic species have the potential to be impacted by toxic materials
in the drilling muds as the discharged materials settle through the water
column. Such impacts should be negligible for two reasons. First, drilling
muds and cuttings will be diluted and dispersed quickly. Exposure time
to the discharged materials will, therefore, be of very short duration.
Second, pelagic species should be able to avoid the waste field easily.

    Demersal nektonic species may be impacted through the same mechanisms
discussed above for riserless drilling operations: smothering of demersal
eggs, acute and chronic toxicities, bioaccumulation, and reduced food supplies.
But since the discharged muds and cuttings will settle through the water
column before being deposited on the sea floor, they will be much more
dispersed on the bottom compared with riserless drilling discharges. The
area of bottom upon which they settle will be determined by the volume
of discharged materials, the rate at which they are discharged, the water
depth, and the surface and subsurface currents at the time of discharge.
In water depths typical of the ODP [i.e., water depths well in excess of
200 m (656 ft)], the drilling muds and cuttings will be greatly dispersed
upon reaching the bottom (see Section 4.2). The greater the area over
which the muds and cuttings are dispersed, the thinner the deposits will
be. Based on the worst-case analysis presented in Section 4.2, the maximum
expected thickness of muds and cuttings deposited on the bottom is <0.01
mm at a water depth of 190 m (623 ft). Water depths at most ODP drill
sites are expected to result in yet smaller deposition thicknesses for
drilling muds and cuttings. Accumulations of muds and cuttings less than
1 mm (0.04 in) are expected to have negligible impacts on benthic communities
(see "Impacts on Benthos" below). Hence, impacts to demersal fishes through
reductions on prey populations and the other mechanisms listed above are
expected to be negligible.

IMPACT ON BENTHOS

Presence of Drillship

    The presence of the drillship should have no impact on benthic commun-
ities, since the small quantities of wastes discharged from the ship should
be diluted to undetectable levels before reaching the seafloor.

173
Riserless Drilling Operations

Seawater, drill cuttings, and some drilling muds will be discharged 
on the sediment surface.  The area affected by the discharge will vary 
with the volume of the discharge, the discharge rate, and the current velocity 
at the sediment-water interface.  Persistence of the discharge pile will 
depend on periodic storms (at continental shelf depths) and currents (at 
all depths).  Drilling muds and cuttings could impact benthic communities 
through smothering, changes in substrate characteristics, toxic effects, 
and bioaccumulation.

Smothering--

Because nearly all cuttings and muds are expected to be deposited 
in the immediate vicinity of the well site, smothering of the resident 
infaunal and epifaunal biota is expected in this area.  Smothering will 
extend farthest from the well site in the mean downcurrent direction. 
The deposition depths at which various species may be smothered is not 
well known.  Experiments with large clams indicate that critical depths 
of burial occurred at 5-10 cm (2-4 in) (Armstrong 1965) and were, possibly, 
related to siphon length.  Large clams with long siphons could reasonably 
be expected to tolerate greater burial depths than many other infaunal 
organisms (i.e., polychaetes, small molluscs, crustaceans).  Smothering 
of a substantial portion of the infaunal biota will probably occur at burial 
depths ≥1 cm (0.4 in).  Based on the worst-case analysis presented in Section 
4.2, drilling muds and cuttings could be deposited at a uniform thickness 
of 1 cm (0.4 in) over an area of 0.4 km2 (0.15 mi2), an area equivalent 
to a 220 m (623 ft) diameter circle.  This is considered negligible compared 
with the size of the ecosystem.  Large motile epifaunal organisms (e.g., 
crabs, lobsters) should not be smothered because of their ability to avoid 
the discharge area.

Changes in Substrate Characteristics--

Benthic community structure and function are largely determined by 
the characteristics of the sedimentary habitat (see Gray 1974; Rhoads 1974). 
Therefore, changes in the characteristics of the sediments in the vicinity 
of the borehole may be expected to impact benthic communities.  Such impacts 
will vary spatially and temporally as the drilling muds and cuttings are 
dispersed by currents and storm activity.

From studies at two sites on Georges Bank (see National Research Council 
1983) and at 120-m (394-ft) depth off New Jersey (Menzie et al. 1980), 
it appears that alterations of sediment characteristics impact the benthos 
more subtly, but over larger areas, than does smothering.  Menzie et al. (1980) 
observed significantly reduced (probability level not stated) abundances 
of polychaetes, molluscs, and crustaceans up to 370 m (1,214 ft) from the 
drill site.  In all three cases, reduced abundances were significantly 
negatively correlated (probability level not stated) with the percent of 
drilling-derived clay in the sediments.  Echinoderms (principally ophiuroids) 
were also reduced in abundance, but the reductions were not significantly 
negatively correlated (probability level not stated) with the drilling-
derived clay content of the sediments.  Shannon-Wiener diversity values 
(H') at the New Jersey site were somewhat reduced after drilling (ranging

174
from 2.75-5.45, compared with predrilling values ranging from 4.34-5.29),
with most low values observed in the imediate vicinity of the drill site.
Menzie et al. (1980) attributed the lower diversity values to lower numbers
of species.  Species evenness (J) was relatively constant over the discharge
area and increased somewhat after drilling (Menzie et al. 1980).  Maurer
et al. (1981) reported that neither species composition nor the predominant
feeding types changed appreciably at the New Jersey site after the initiation
of drilling.

Based on the studies on Georges Bank and off New Jersey, it appears
that greatest impacts to benthic infauna communities due to sediment alteration
occur in areas nearest the borehole. Reduced abundances of polychaetes,
molluscs, and crustaceans are likely to occur, and Shannon-Wiener diversity
values may be depressed. Major changes in species composition and feeding
types were not observed in the vicinity of the New Jersey well site. Such
changes near ODP drill sites cannot be eliminated as a possibility due
to differences in the volumes of discharged materials, the physical charac-
teristics of the receiving environment, and the affected benthic communities.
Resident species at ODP drill sites that are intolerant of altered sediment
characteristics may be replaced by species better adapted to the altered
conditions.

Altered sediment composition may also compromise the abilities of
infaunal or epifaunal invertebrates to recruit, grow, and propagate in
the vicinity of the drill sites. Should altered sediment composition negatively
impact the larvae, juveniles, or adults of commercially valuable benthic
species, the amount of habitat available for those species would be reduced.
Impacts on commercially valuable species of benthic invertebrates would
be greatest in major fisheries areas such as Georges Bank.

It is difficult to determine the area over which subtle impacts to
benthic infauna (e.g., changes in species composition and abundances, but
not smothering) would occur in response to the deposition of drilling muds
and cuttings, since no quantitative data on the relationship between depth
of deposition and such changes are available. However, assume for the
moment that changes in species composition and abundance will occur at
deposition thicknesses of 1 mm (0.04 in) or greater.  Based on results
of the worst-case analysis presented above (Section 4.2), the maximum area
over which muds and cuttings would be deposited at an even thickness of
1.0 mm (0.04 in) is 37 km2 (14.3 mi2), an area equivalent to a 6.9 km (4.3
mi) circle. As the concentrations of drilling muds and cuttings are reduced
to undetectable levels through the actions of currents, tides, storms,
and bioturbation, species composition and abundances are expected to return
to predischarge conditions.

Large, motile epifaunal benthic species are not likely to be impacted
directly by altered sediment characteristics, since they should be able
to avoid areas of greatest deposition. They may be impacted indirectly
if benthic infauna communities are greatly altered, since the abundances
of prey organisms consumed by the epifaunal taxa may be reduced.  Such
reductions might occur if the epifaunal species were unable to utilize
the "new" benthic prey organisms. However, impacts of altered sediment
characteristics on large, motile epifaunal species are expected to be negli-
175
gible because infaunal communities would be changed over only a minor portion
of the total forage area available to an epifaunal predator.

To date, no studies have been conducted on the potential for pollutant
impacts to the biota of hydrothermal vents. Hence, the sensitivities of
those species to suspended and deposited solids are unknown. Vent species
might exhibit high sensitivities to deposited solids, however, because
they are dependent on sulfides and bacteria in the vent water, and on nutrients
in the water column. Particulates suspended in the water column and on
the bottom might interfere with the abilities of the biota to use these
resources.

Acute and Chronic Toxicity--

Drilling muds and cuttings discharged on the seafloor may impact benthic
organisms through the toxic actions of some of the drilling mud components.
The toxic components of most concern are barium, chromium, cadmium, copper,
iron, mercury, lead, and zinc (Neff 1981). Metal enrichment of the sediments
in the vicinity of a drill site is typically very uneven, but usually decreases
as one moves away from the drill site (Neff 1981). For surface-discharged
muds and cuttings, major metal enrichments may occur within 100 m (328
ft) of the discharge point, and background concentrations may be reached
within 1,000 m (3,281 ft) (Neff 1981). Bottom discharges from riserless
drilling operations should exhibit higher metals concentrations near the
borehole than do surface discharges from riser drilling operations. However,
the gradient of metal concentrations should decrease more quickly with
distance from the drill site.

Of the metals found in drilling muds, barium is usually the most highly
concentrated in the sediments because it occurs at high concentrations
in drilling muds, it is relatively insoluble, and it occurs in high-density
forms (Neff 1981). However, as noted above (see section on Impacts of
Nekton), the most toxic metal commonly found in water-based drilling muds
is chromium, which may occur as chrome or ferrochrome lignosulfonate (National
Research Council 1983). Chrome and ferrochrome lignosulfonates are generally
"moderately toxic" to benthic invertebrates, with most 96-hour LC50 values
ranging from 100 to 1,000 ppm. Tests have shown that pure barite is not
a major toxicant to benthic organisms, except when present at very high
concentrations for long periods of time (see Neff 1981). Such conditions
might occur in the immediate vicinity of an ODP drill hole, but would eventually
be eliminated as the mud and cuttings pile was dissipated by bottom currents
and bioturbation. Moreover, most barite in drilling muds is tightly bound
to the clay-lignosulfonate fraction and would be expected to behave differently
(i.e., to be less toxic) than pure barite.

Overall, tests have shown that the suspended particulate phases of
drilling muds to which benthic invertebrates would be exposed are only
"slightly toxic" or "practically non-toxic" (Neff 1981; National Research
Council 1983). Most short-term acute toxicity tests have LC50 values >10,000
ppm. Less than 2 percent of the suspended particulate phase tests were
moderately toxic to the species tested (i.e., short-term LC50 values of
100-1,000 ppm). Invertebrate larvae tended to be more sensitive to the
suspended particulate phases of drilling muds than were adult organisms.
However, much of this increased sensitivity may have been due to the clogging

176
of respiratory surfaces rather than to toxic effects of metals or other 
substances (Neff 1981). Organisms from one biogeographic region do not 
appear to be more sensitive to drilling muds than do organisms from any 
other biogeographic region (National Research Council 1983). Hence, results 
of tests on organisms from one region may be extrapolated to another region. 
No tests have been conducted on hydrothermal vent organisms, many of which 
are unique in the animal kingdom. Hence, their sensitivities to toxic 
substances in drilling muds are not known.

Chronic and sublethal effects of drilling mud components generally 
occur at concentrations one to two orders of magnitude less than those 
required to produce an acute toxic response (Neff 1981; National Research 
Council 1983). Chronic effects tend to occur at 10-1,000 ppm of the suspended 
particulate phase for most species tested. Chronic effects for sensitive 
species and sensitive (i.e., early) life stages generally occur at 10-100 ppm 
of the suspended particulate phase. Again, abrasion and clogging of respiratory 
surfaces, not toxicity, is often cited as the major cause of effects on 
sensitive species and early life stages. Results for chronic and sublethal 
toxicities are all based on tests for barite and various biocides; chrome 
lignosulfonate has not been tested for chronic effects (Neff 1981).

Because toxic components of drilling muds may be present in the vicinity 
of a borehole for months, or possibly years, chronic effects on benthic 
organisms may be important within that small area. Chronic and sublethal 
toxicity tests conducted to date have not attempted to realistically duplicate 
conditions that would be expected on the seafloor. Therefore the actual 
potential for chronic and sublethal toxic effects in the receiving environment 
is very difficult to assess.

In summary, toxicity tests have shown the components of drilling muds 
to be only "slightly toxic" to benthic organisms in most cases. This con-
clusion, coupled with the prediction that drilling muds and cuttings will 
cause major changes in the benthic environment over a very limited area 
[i.e., within 1,000 m (3,281 ft) of the drill site], suggests that the 
impacts of toxic substances on benthic organisms (with the possible exception 
of hydrothermal vent species) will be minor and will occur over very small 
areas of the seafloor.

Bioaccumulation--

Benthic organisms bioaccumulate metals found in drilling muds (see 
Neff 1981; National Research Council 1983). (Note, however, that no studies 
have been conducted which document the abilities of hydrothermal vent species 
to bioaccumulate metals.) Although chromium appears to be the metal most 
easily bioaccumulated, it is bound to clay particles and to high molecular 
weight lignosulfonate fractions of the drilling mud. Hence, it has a low 
bioavailability (Neff 1981). (Chromium and other metals are more readily 
bioavailable as ions in solution.) Lead, zinc, and possibly cadmium are 
also tightly bound to particulate fractions, and have a low bioavailability 
(Neff 1981). There is no evidence that metals found in drilling muds biomagnify 
to higher trophic levels (National Research Council 1983).

Although tests have documented the bioaccumulation of metals from 
drilling muds in benthic organisms, they have not determined whether these

177
toxic substances are present at intracellular sites of toxic action.  Nor 
have the tests documented whether the organisms are sequestering or detoxifying 
the bioaccumulated substances (National Research Council 1983).  For these 
reasons, it is difficult to evaluate fully the impact of the bioaccumulation 
of metals from drilling muds on benthic organisms.  However, Neff (1981) 
concluded that at the concentrations of drilling muds in the sediments 
to which benthic organisms will be exposed in the field, metals are unlikely 
to be bioaccumulated to levels that would pose a toxic hazard to the benthic 
organisms themselves or to predators, including humans.

The potential for bioaccumulation by benthic organisms will exist 
at an ODP drill site only as long as the metals content of the sediments 
is above background levels.  Because drilling muds and cuttings are expected 
to be dispersed relatively quickly by storm activity and currents, because 
the area affected by drilling muds and cuttings is expected to be very 
small relative to the size of the ecosystem, and because initial concentrations 
of metals in the sediments are expected to be low, the impact of metals 
bioaccumulation on benthic organisms and their predators is expected to 
be negligible.

Riser Drilling Operations

As discussed above for riserless drilling operations, impacts on benthic 
communities are expected to be negligible and will only occur when drilling 
muds and cuttings do not disperse enough to prevent smothering.  Compared 
with riserless drilling operations, muds and cuttings should be dispersed 
over a much greater area initially and are not expected to be deposited 
at thicknesses that would cause changes in benthic species composition 
or abundance.

IMPACT ON MARINE MAMMALS AND BIRDS

Marine Mammals

The ODP could potentially affect marine mammals in the following ways:

  The drillship, either in transit or on station, could interfere 
with marine mammal movements.

  Noise produced by ODP activities could disturb marine mammals 
or interfere with their vocalization.

  Discharges from the drillship could disturb marine mammals 
or affect their food sources.

The various components of ODP operations and the range of potential impacts 
resulting from those operations are summarized in Figure 49.

Presence of Drillship--

The physical presence of the drillship, whether in transit or on station, 
is unlikely to interfere significantly with marine mammal movement.  Close 
approaches of the ship to marine mammals (or vice versa) are expected to 
be rare, considering that only one ship is involved and that the average

Figure 49.  Factors associated with scientific drilling effects on marine mammals.
density of marine mammals in the open ocean is very low. When close approaches occur, the mobility of marine mammals and their ability to detect the ship would permit them to easily avoid contact, especially since the top speed of the drilling ship is only 14 kn. Therefore, collisions between the drilling ship and marine mammals are not expected to occur. Detours made by marine mammals to avoid the ship will be a strictly temporary situation and will not represent a significant effect on the individuals involved.

ODP activities producing noises which could disturb marine mammals are seismic surveys, general ship noises (e.g., noise from drilling operations, engine operation, dynamic positioning), and helicopter operation.  Seismic profiling, which produces the highest elevations over ambient conditions, will only be run for up to 19 km (12 mi) during the initial approach to the station. Malme et al. (1984) reported that gray whales avoid noises from all three of these sources, but that the strongest response was to seismic survey noise. The distances at which gray whales showed a 50 percent probability of exhibiting avoidance response (change in direction, reduction of speed) were 2.5 km (1.6 mi) for seismic survey activities, 1.1 km (0.7 mi) for drilling ships, and only 80 m (262 ft) for helicopter overflight. Stewart et al. (1983) observed that beluga whales had little response to drilling noise. Constant noise elicited no response, while changes in tone and level resulted in temporary avoidance behavior. When approached by boat or aircraft, bowhead whales have been observed to change behavior, including changing breathing rates, surfacing intervals, and time spent on the surface (LGL 1983). Bowhead whales have also been observed to change behavior in response to seismic survey noise, particularly at start-up of survey operations (LGL 1982).

These observations indicate that cetaceans in the vicinity of the drillship are likely to change their behavior slightly in response to noises from ship operations, drilling operations, seismic surveys, and helicopter operation. Pinnipeds, which are generally less acoustically oriented than cetaceans, are likely to be affected less by these noises. The magnitude of the behavioral response will depend on the species and on the type of activity. Responses include temporary changes in transit course to avoid the noise source and other minor changes in behavior. Since marine mammals will be close to the noise-generating ODP activities only a fraction of the operating time, and since relatively few individual mammals will be affected by these noises, the overall effect on any species' population is expected to be negligible.

Helicopter overflights will be infrequent and will affect a given location on the surface only temporarily. Disturbances to individual marine mammals at sea are expected only rarely, and, when they occur, in a temporary and insignificant manner. The greatest potential affect from helicopters is disturbance of pinnipeds breeding rookeries. Several pinniped species have been observed to temporarily vacate rookery areas for the water in response to aircraft overflights. Most individuals return to the shore within a few minutes of the end of the disturbance (Bowles and Stewart 1980). However, rookery abandonment can occur after repeated disturbance. ODP helicopter flights fly the same course twice. Due to movements of the ship and the infrequent nature of ODP helicopter use, the chance that a pinniped rookery will be abandoned due to helicopter overflight is negligible. Even one-time transitory disturbance of rookery areas is unlikely,

180
due to the infrequency of flights and the small likelihood of flights passing
over rookeries. Drilling and seismic survey operations will be too far
offshore to affect rookeries or other nearshore areas used by pinnipeds.

The highest noise levels produced by ODP activities will be in the
100-200 Hz range, which coincides with the range of most cetacean call
vocalizations. This raises the potential that ODP-generated noise will
interfere with cetacean vocalization, communication, and possibly echo-
location. According to Cummings et al. (1981), drilling and seismic operations
are likely to interfere with vocalization of nearby cetaceans, but the
degree and significance of this effect is not known. It would probably
be minor since most animals would avoid these noise sources and since those
that did not would be affected only until they moved out of the noise range.
Effects would be insignificant for a given cetacean population. Echo sounding
frequencies used for dynamic positioning may interfere with vocalization
and echo location of toothed whales, although only in the immediate vicinity
of the ship while on-station. Since pinnipeds rely less on acoustic cues
for communication, navigation, and feeding, ODP-generated noise is less
likely to interfere with vocalization and communication.

Drilling Operations--

Effects on water quality from drillship discharges are expected to
be minor and localized near the ship (see Section 4.4). Disturbance effects
are likely to keep mammals outside the small area where any harmful chemical
effects might occur. Direct physical or toxicological effects of these
discharges on marine mammals are therefore unlikely and few animals would
be affected. In addition, mobility and detection ability of marine mammals
allows them to avoid significant discharge plumes. However, some ingestion
of toxic drilling mud constituents is possible by planktonic filter feeders
and benthic detritivores. Indirect effects on marine mammals, such as
effects on food organisms, are unlikely, because effects on plankton and
fish are expected to be small (discussed earlier in this section). Resulting
effects on marine mammal predators are expected to be negligible.

Marine Birds

The ODP could affect marine birds only through: 1) disturbance of
bird colonies by helicopter overflights; 2) direct effects of various discharges
on birds on or in the water; or 3) indirect effects of discharges on birds
through effects on fish or plankton on which birds feed.

Presence of Drillship--

Low altitude helicopter flights over marine bird rookeries or resting
areas on land or water are likely to startle birds causing some or all
to take flight temporarily. Since disturbances are expected to be only
occasional and transitory, conditions and bird behavior would quickly return
to normal. Such disturbance of birds that are resting or congregating
(but not nesting) should be insignificant. Nesting marine birds have been
observed to be less easily startled than non-nesting birds. Nesting birds
startled from the nest do not generally damage eggs or chicks, nor leave
the nest long enough for predation on eggs or chicks to occur (Schreiber
and Schreiber 1980). Therefore, single helicopter flights over rookeries

181
should not result in significant mortality of eggs or chicks, or have adverse
effects on marine bird populations.  Repeated flights over rookeries, which
would pose a greater potential for affecting nesting birds, are unlikely
due to the infrequency of these flights and the drillship's frequent moves.
Birds in flight (e.g., in transit, foraging) should be able to avoid the
helicopter, and any resulting disturbances will be temporary and insignificant.
Based on all the above considerations, ODP helicopter overflights are expected
to (occasionally if at all) have minor adverse effects on marine birds.

Drilling Operations--

Surface discharges form the drillship (e.g., muds and cuttings, sanitary/
domestic waste) are expected to have only minor affects on water quality
in a very localized area near the drillship (Section 4.4).  Marine birds
that dive or rest on the water's surface have the ability to avoid discharge
plumes.  Therefore, significant direct physical or toxicological effects
of ODP discharges on marine birds are not expected. The effects of ODP
discharges on fish and zooplankton are expected to be minor and very localized
(discussed earlier in this section), resulting in negligible indirect effects
on marine birds.

IMPACT ON ENDANGERED SPECIES

Endangered and threatened species occurring in the four representative
drilling locations are pinnipeds (Weddell Sea), cetaceans (all four locations),
sea turtles (eastern tropical Pacific and Georges Bank), and the dark-rumped
petrel and Parkinson's petrel (eastern tropical Pacific).  It was concluded
earlier in this section that the ODP would not have significant impacts
on marine mammals and birds, and this would apply to endangered and threatened
species.

Sea turtles occur in both coastal and open ocean waters.  However,
three endangered species, the hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), the Atlantic
Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), and the Pacific Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea)
sea turtles are primarily coastal and vulnerable only in coastal drilling
sites, such as the Middle America Trench (Pacific Ridley).  Other sea turtles
species could occur in most tropical, subtropical, or temperate drilling
locations, whether nearshore or offshore.

The ODP could affect sea turtles through effects of ODP-generated
discharges and through collisions between sea turtles and the drillship.
Unlike marine mammals, sea turtles are not known to be acoustically sensitive
or to depend heavily on acoustic cues for communication, navigation, or
feeding.  For this reason, they will not be potentially affected by ODP-
generated noise.  Because ODP surface discharges (e.g., drilling muds and
cuttings, sanitary and domestic wastes) are expected to affect water quality
in a minor and localized manner, relatively few sea turtles will be affected
over the course of the program.  Drill sites are far enough offshore that
ODP-generated discharges should have a negligible effect on hatchling sea
turtles.

Although sea turtles are generally not mobile enough to avoid the
moving drillship in case of an imminent collision, such situations are
expected to be very rare, because only one ship is involved and the density

182
of turtles in the open ocean is very low. Therefore, very few sea turtles 
are likely to be involved in collisions with the drillship, and the resulting 
effects on turtle populations will be negligible.

IMPACT ON BIOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS

Areas considered biologically sensitive in the Weddell Sea are the 
terrestrial environment, ice-edge communities, and rookeries of marine 
mammals and birds. Surface discharges from ODP activities will not persist 
long enough to be transported to terrestrial or ice-edge habitats. Earlier 
in this section it was concluded that, while marine mammal and bird rookeries 
may infrequently be disturbed by ODP helicopter overflights, only temporary, 
negligible impacts on mammal or bird populations are expected.

Other biologically sensitive features are the productive fish populations 
and commercial fisheries. These are not expected to be significantly impacted 
by the ODP, as discussed earlier in this section and in Section 4.6.

ODP activities and related discharges will be located far enough offshore 
from biologically sensitive islands, such as the the Galapagos Islands, 
to not significantly impact biological resources at these locations. Likewise, 
ODP activities and discharges will be located too far offshore to affect 
sea turtle breeding areas on coastal beaches or other sensitive estuarine 
or marshland habitats.

Section 4.6
IMPACT OF THE ODP ON THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT

IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY

The ODP is a long-term program of fundamental research on the earth's crust beneath the oceans. The scope is global, extending eventually into every ocean. The ODP components include planning, management, design, fabrication and construction, testing, field operations, sample handling, and data handling.  The principal locations on land at which these activities take place are Washington, DC; College Station, Texas; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Palisades, New York, and a number of ports of call in the U.S. and other countries. All of these places will benefit economically by the local project-related expenditures and by the direct and indirect jobs thereby created.

The present ODP funding estimate for a 5-year program starting in 1984 is $192 million, of which $141 million will be contributed by the U.S. and $51 million by foreign participants.  In 1984, about $22 million were budgeted to organize activities at Texas A & M University in College Station, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, and in retrofitting the drillship JOIDES RESOLUTION at Pascagoula, Mississippi.  Direct expenditures on payroll, goods, and materials have thus brought economic benefits to these communities. By creating other jobs, fusion of that money into the local economies has had a multiplier effect in the regional economics of Texas, Mississippi, and other areas where project-related expenditures have been made. Further expenditures in the future will similarly generate new employment and economic growth in areas where worker payrolls will be spent and project related equipment and supplies will be bought.

IMPACTS ON OTHER USES OF THE ENVIRONMENT

Since the ODP will involve only one ship and since drilling will not be conducted for more than 3 months in any given area, it seems unlikely that the program would have significant adverse effects on such activities as commercial fisheries, military operations, transportation, resource development, and other scientific research.  The probability of adverse impacts is further reduced since state-of-the-art technology and procedures will be used to minimize the possibility of blowouts and the introduction of oil or other contaminants into the marine environment.

The potential for impacts on individual resources is further explored below.  Both adverse and beneficial impacts are identified.

Commercial Fisheries

ODP activities will have a negligible impact on commercial fisheries (see Section 4.5).  However, impacts could occur primarily from spatial exclusion of fishing by the drillship for the period of its operation in the area and from oil spills. Impacts to fisheries in the Georges Bank region were investigated by the Minerals Management Service-funded study "Assessing the Impacts of Oil Spills on a Commercial Fishery" (University

184
of Rhode Island and Applied Science Associates, Inc. 1982).  Potential 
impacts from 15 hydrocarbon exploration wells and 78 delineation and production 
wells concentrated in one area were considered to be moderate.  In the 
analysis, portions of regional populations changed in number and/or distribution 
for at least one year class (generation), but the regional population, 
as a whole, was unlikely to be adversely affected. Depending on the species 
and subsequent environmental conditions, this could have long-ranging impacts 
on a population.

ODP activity is not planned in geologic formations suitable for oil 
and gas accumulation.  If drilling in such locations takes place, then 
it will be done with a riser and blowout prevention system.  Therefore, 
the probability of an accidental oil spill is considered to be minimal. 
Compared to full-fledged oil and gas activities, ODP activity at sites 
with a productive fishery will be few and short-term.  This reduces the 
risk of accidental oil spill still further.  Mitigating measures employed 
by the ODP are discussed in detail in Section 4.8.

Military Uses

It is anticipated that ODP sites will avoid all areas of designated 
military activities. If scientific objectives of the program require investi-
gation in areas where conflicts with military activities may occur, the 
U.S. Department of Defense, or similar agencies of the countries in whose 
jurisdiction the ODP activity may take place, will be consulted prior to 
selection of sites. During operations, the ODP notifies the Defense Mapping 
Hydrography/Topography Center of changes in location and activities that 
will occur at each site.

Transportation

Existence of one ship, JOIDES RESOLUTION, for a brief period in any 
given location (mostly in international waters) will not impact general 
transportation at sea.  To the extent possible, sites will be chosen to 
avoid heavily traveled traffic lanes on the open seas.  Within coastal 
areas. If scientific objectives require drilling in areas where conflict 
may arise, prior consultation with U.S. Coast Guard or similar agencies 
in other countries will be carried out to minimize impacts.

Resource Development

ODP-related drilling activity could temporarily interfere with activities 
related to the development of other resources (e.g., oil, gas, and other 
minerals).  Due to the very short duration of ODP activity in any given 
location, such interference, if any, would be minimal and insignificant. 
On the other hand, development of other resources may be made possible 
by the knowledge gained from ODP activity.

                                                    185
Other Scientific Research

The presence of JOIDES RESOLUTION could temporarily interfere with 
other scientific research occuring at the same time.  The probability of 
such interference is small since all sites to be drilled are selected at 
least 1 year in advance.  This information will be passed on to the countries 
in whose jurisdiction drilling may occur.  These countries are also invited 
to send two of their scientists on that leg, offering a unique opportunity 
for scientific research that would have otherwise not been possible.  In 
addition, beneficial effects of the knowledge gained during the ODP on 
other scientific research are likely.

IMPACT ON LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES

Under international law, as reflected in the 1982 Convention on Law 
of the Sea, drilling within the Exclusive Economic Zone or on the continental 
shelf of another coastal nation, requires that country's prior consent.  
The Office of Marine Science and Technology Affairs in the U.S. Department 
of State, as the liaison between the NSF science operator and the country, 
formally requests permission to conduct research drilling in the country's 
territorial waters.

Several program components greatly enhance the gaining of permission 
from other coastal nations.  A rigorous system of pre-drilling safety reviews 
minimizes the risk of encountering high pressure zones or hydrocarbon accumula-
tions.  Indemnification against accidental spillages or other problems 
that could arise out of the drilling operation has been provided for by 
Congress.  Participation of the country's geologists and oceanographers 
is invited and expected to be accepted because of the inherent scientific 
interest.  Geologic data collected including geophysical records, core 
descriptions and other pertinent results are made available to the country 
as soon as possible, and copies of resulting publications are supplied 
as they are printed.

All activities in the Antarctic are governed by the Antarctic Treaty 
of 1959, recommendations adopted under the Treaty, and the Antarctic Conser-
vation Act of 1978.  The ODP's proposed scientific drilling with free avail-
ability of the data retrieved differentiates it from resource prospecting 
which is voluntarily restrained under a 1977 Treaty agreement on mineral-
resource exploration and exploitation (Treaty Recommendation IX-1).  NSF's 
Division of Polar Programs, by annual transmittal of planned activities 
through diplomatic channels, will provide advance notice of Antarctic drilling 
operations to the governments of all other Antarctic Treaty signatories 
and to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR is the primary 
scientific advisory body to the treaty nations).  This EIS and information 
on planned research synopsis, ship's tracks, and participating scientists 
will be compiled and made available as required by Treaty Article VII(5).  
Thus, proposed ODP activities are consistent with the Antarctic Treaty 
and with the policy of voluntary restraint from mineral exploration in 
Antarctica.

186
Article II of the Convention on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR) establishes a "conservation standard" to protect Antarctic 
marine living resources.  The CCAMLR and a U.S. law and implementing regulations 
have been in force since 1982; ODP operations in the Antartic will be guided 
by these regulations.

IMPACT ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER

Technology plays a major role in the ocean drilling program.  ODP's 
predecessor, the Deep Sea Drilling Project (1968-1983), pioneered many 
of the technologies in common use in offshore industry today.  These include

  Dynamic positioning of the drillship

  Roller core coring bit

  Re-entry of formerly drilled holes

  Recovery of undisturbed sediment cores; hydropiston coring, 
extended core barrels, and other coring equipment.

The ODP will again use a number of new tools, equipment and techniques 
in order to provide the maximum scientific returns.  Among the technical 
advances of the Ocean Drilling Program are:

  A modern state-of-the-art drillship, JOIDES RESOLUTION, 
capable of drilling to 9,000 m (29,520 feet) in all of the 
world's ocean with well-equipped, spacious laboratories, 
and berthing for 50 scientists and technicians.  The ship 
is ice-strengthened and is capable of high-latitude operations 
previously not feasible.

  A complete program of scientific logging including a suite 
of the most advanced logging tools available or developed 
particularly for ODP.  Specially developed tools include:

    Downhole wireline packer
    Analog borehole televiewer
    Twelve-channel sonic logging tool
    Digital borehole televiewer
    Logging tool heave compensation system.

  An enhanced program of support for downhole experiments 
such as:

    Downhole seismology
    Hydrogeology - downhole fluid flow and velocity
    Resistivity, temperature, and heat flow
    Downhole water chemistry
    Stress and rate of strain in crustal boreholes.

                                                     187
•   Development of advanced tools and techniques for drilling 
    in previously inaccessible areas and for improving drilling 
    and coring technology. These include:

    -   A bare rock drilling system which will enable the drill 
        to "spud in" in areas where little or no sediment cover 
        exists
    -   An improved drill-in-casing system; improved bit life 
        and penetration rates in hard rocks
    -   The use of mud motors to improve coring rates and recovery
    -   Design of a 9,000-m (29,520-foot) drill string and 
        drill string quality control and analysis programs
    -   A drilling system that can be used in geothermally 
        active regions where temperatures as high as 3000 C 
        may be encountered.

In addition to these tasks, ODP engineers will continue work on improving 
and developing scientific coring systems such as the hydraulic piston corer, 
the extended core barrel, and the pressure core barrel.

Any technological advances achieved by the ODP will be openly available 
to the countries participating in support of the program.  Engineering 
plans and specifications for tools developed for the program will also 
be available to the members.  The resulting development of equipment and 
technology will aid the petroleum industry and the people of all nations.

188
Section 4.7
MISHAPS AND ACCIDENTS

Mishaps and accidents occasionally occur in drilling operations, and the potential exists for these situations to arise during the course of the ODP. Impacts discussed earlier in the chapter are those resulting from normal ODP operations. Potential mishaps, accidents, and impacts that could result from encountering unexpected conditions are discussed in this section. Mishaps could result from storms, unexpected geologic anomalies, or blowouts. Most resulting impacts would be caused by material fluxes into the environment. In compliance with Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, the range of potential impacts up to a hypothetical worst-case analysis is addressed. The probability of occurrence of any mishap during the ODP is low (as exemplified by the excellent safety record of the DSDP). The worst-case mishap is highly improbable. Contingency plans exist and shipboard personnel are properly trained to respond to emergency situations safely and effectively. Measures built into the ODP for preventing and mitigating impacts are discussed in Section 4.8.

OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS

The occupational hazards expected for the ODP should not differ significantly from normal occupational hazards associated with the operations on an ocean-going vessel, a drill rig, or laboratory. Crew members are trained in safety measures, and specific procedures for normal operations and emergency situations are outlined in the SEDCO Safety Manual (SEDCO 1982). In addition, the ODP provides the Shipboard Scientific Handbook (ODP 1985), which details operating procedures, safety measures, and emergency operations, to all cruise participants. The exceptional safety record compiled during the DSDP is expected to continue through the ODP.

LOSS OF RISER AND DRILL STRING

If a sudden, severe storm or squall should blow the ship off the drill site during drilling, loss of the drill string (riserless drilling) or riser and drill string (riser drilling), and all downhole or subsea equipment in use at the time, are possible. Geologic conditions, such as those identified in Section 4.3, could result in these same losses. The immediate and inevitable result would be the deposition of the equipment on the seafloor, with recovery probably being impractical.

Depending on downhole conditions at the time of the accident, it may be necessary to locate and re-enter the hole (if possible). A backup drill string and the technology to find and plug the hole do exist. Failure to plug the hole (if conditions monitored during the earlier drilling suggested it was necessary) may result in chronic exchange of formation fluids and seawater. Depending on the direction of flow and composition of formation fluid, impacts could range between none and a persistent exchange of local bottom water with formation fluids that are toxic to the local benthic community. In many situations, geothermal heating of the formation fluids

189
could result in the release of a buoyant plume from the borehole.  The 
plume, entraining ambient water as it rises, would eventually spread laterally 
at some level of neutral buoyancy in the water column. Resulting impacts 
to water column organisms would be localized and negligible.  However, 
high dissolved solids concentrations and cooling before reaching the seafloor 
could result in a negatively buoyant plume that would spread down current 
from the borehole along the ocean bottom.  These fluids could persist in 
the low-energy abyssal environment.  Dissipation is largely by diffusion 
in these areas of minimal vertical mixing.

AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS

The probability of releasing substantial volumes of subsurface aqueous 
solutions is small. Evidence of excess fluid pressures  in formations in 
the geological provinces planned for drilling was found in the Galapagos 
Spreading Center off the East Pacific Rise. Pressurized fluids could flow 
into the hole and out into the ocean environment until pressure equalization 
is achieved.  However, intercommunication of fluids between formations 
is unlikely, limiting the total volume that could be released.  As a preven-
tive measure, every hole over 400 m deep will be logged, yielding information 
on formation properties that can indicate potential for fluid exchange.  
Abandonment procedures call for sealing off of the interval in question 
with either heavy mud or cement as conditions require.

When drilling into oceanic crustal rocks, temperatures as high as 
2600 C have been recorded.  Fluids in the hole would be mainly seawater.  
After abandonment, thermal convection may develop in the holes, with the 
warmed fluid convecting out by mixing between convective cells that could 
develop from the thermal gradient in the rock.  Dissolved gases and some 
solids would be present.  No measurable environmental impacts would result 
and these holes will not have to be filled.

Evidence exists for hydrothermal circulation of fluids in oceanic 
crust for some distance out from spreading centers where heat flow is high.  
These migrations probably occur through fissures and voids.  It is doubtful 
that a drilled hole would contribute significantly to this natural process.  
Holes can be filled with weighted mud and/or cemented to inhibit hydrothermal 
circulation through the hole.

MAGMAS

Magma chambers can exist as little as 1-3 km (0.6-1.9 mi) beneath 
active spreading centers, well within obtainable depths with ODP drilling.  
However, drilling cannot physically proceed to the point of encountering 
magma at depth, since metal failure of the bit would occur first.  No evidence 
has been assembled to suggest that such activities might possibly produce 
a volcano that would not occur naturally, or accelerate such an occurrence.

                                                      190
BLOWOUT OF GAS OR BRINE

Geopressurized gas or formation fluids may be encountered whenever drilling into and through sedimentary sequences. The presence of shallow gas deposits and clathrate (gas hydrates) zones is of primary concern. Fortunately, both are usually detectable with the modern geophysical techniques used by the ODP during site selection surveys, greatly reducing the probability of encounter and the potential of a blowout.

Shallow gas deposits can occur in any water depth when pressurized gas has migrated up faults, unconsolidated shales or cherts, or fossiliferous zones, into unconsolidated sediments near the surface. In addition, decomposed clathrates can produce shallow gas accumulations with abnormally high pressure (Taylor et al. 1979). Potential conduits are usually detectable as shallow faulting or Landward Dipping Reflectors (LDRs) in the seismic record (Moore et al. 1982). The deposits themselves usually show up as "bright spots" in the seismic record, and their small dimensions can be easily avoided in selecting a drill site, reducing chances of a blowout to near zero (Matthews 1974).

In deeper waters, where most ODP activities occur, high pressures or large volumes of gas are unlikely. Therefore, explosive blowout causing damage to downhole equipment is also unlikely (Tucker et al. 1984). In shallower water on continental shelves, where gas deposits are more common, a riser, blowout preventer, and standard control procedures for shallow, high formation pressures will be employed (see Tucker et al. 1984).

A blowout could result in the loss of downhole equipment and a continuing release of gas (including H_(2)S) or formation fluids into the water column. Gas would bubble upwards diffusing into the water column. Concentrations of H_(2)S or hydrocarbons in the water column would be low because of short residence times of the bubbles in relation to the diffusion of gas from the bubbles into the water column. At a pH of 8, 85 to 90 percent of the H_(2)S released in the water column would be present in the ionized form HS^(-) (Rao and Hepler 1977) reducing toxicity to organisms. Reduction of oxygen concentrations as the H_(2)S and hydrocarbons in solution oxidize should not be significant because of the low concentrations expected. The portion reaching the surface (which could include C_(1)-C_(4) hydrocarbon, H_(2)S, and other gases) would be released into the atmosphere, impacting air quality. The depth of drill sites makes it highly improbable that aeration of the water from released gas would cause loss of ship buoyancy. Impacts resulting from release of formation fluids from the hole are discussed earlier in this section.

Gas hydrates (clathrate) are solid, ice-like structures, formed of gas molecules within a lattice of water molecules under specific combinations of high pressure and temperature. The stability zone of gas hydrates in marine sediments is generally found in water depths as shallow as 500 m (1,640 ft) when bottom temperatures are 0^(0) C. Stability zones are deeper in warmer waters. Pressurized gas and fluid may accumulate underneath this layer of gas hydrate in regions where no structural traps exist. However, the bottom of the hydrate zones are usually detectable as Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) on the seismic record (Tucholke et al. 1977; White 1978; Shipley et al. 1979; Dillon et al. 1980).  In addition, pressure

191
barrel cores will be taken to verify or deny the presence of gas hydrates 
in areas where they may exist.  To reduce the risk of a blowout, drilling 
or to proceed deeper when gas hydrates are encountered where the bottom 
boundary (BSR) is not detected.

Releases from a penetrated hydrate layer will be minor.  Decomposition 
of hydrates from the hole into the marine environment is temporary and 
will seal itself.  In the unlikely event that the bottom of the hydrate 
layer is penetrated and free gas or formation fluids are released, impacts 
will be similar to those discussed above. Mitigating measures outlining 
ODP protocol on hydrates encounter are discussed in Section 4.8.

BLOWOUT OF PETROLEUM

Petroleum accumulations may be encountered whenever drilling into 
and through sedimentary sequences.  However, this is the least likely mishap 
in scientific drilling, since extensive measures are used to avoid potential 
petroleum accumulations during site selection and since drilling is stopped, 
the hole is plugged, and the site is abandoned when monitoring of cores 
indicates hydrocarbons.  Details of the extensive safety reviews of each 
site location, methods for hydrocarbon monitoring, and protocol for abandonment 
are discussed later this section and in Section 4.8.

Fifteen years of drilling throughout the world's oceans have produced 
extensive information and experience on which to base the judgment that 
there is an extremely low probability of encountering reservoirs of oil 
or gas during riserless drilling.  Much of the deeper drilling will be 
accomplished in areas that were already characterized during the DSDP as 
thin pelagic sediment cover.  Other work will be done in areas that are 
very similar, from geophysical evidence. Sites are planned for those areas 
of the ocean least likely to contain reservoirs of hydrocarbons.  In regions 
where hydrocarbons are more likely to be found, drilling will be postponed 
until later in the program when riser capability is available.  This will 
permit well control procedures to contain the well until it can be plugged. 
The intention of assuring that sites are of extremely low probabilities 
of hydrocarbons encounter, and conservative monitoring of downhole conditions 
will remain the same for both riser and riserless operations.

During riserless drilling operations, the encounter and release of 
small amounts of hydrocarbons is possible.  Certain procedures enable control 
of minor flows of formation fluids, including hydrocarbons, while operating 
without a riser.  Weighted mud is held in readiness, pre-mixed, and prepared 
for pumping into the hole.  Cement with calibrated setting time can be 
mixed and pumped to seal the hole.  Even if all control attempts fail, 
volume of released petroleum is expected to be minor.  The fate and effect 
of spilled oil in the marine environment are discussed in detail later 
in this chapter.

Worst-Case Analysis

Release of a substantial volume of hydrocarbons can occur only during riser drilling in thick sedimentary sequences (where potential for generation of large amounts exists). Although highly improbable because of intensive pre-drilling site safety reviews, the worst-case scenario entails a blowout of oil or gas and loss of the ship in a remote, environmentally-sensitive area. Hydrocarbons would continue to be released into the environment until another drillship with the depth capabilities of JOIDES RESOLUTION arrives and drills a relief well. This scenario results in large-scale impacts to the environment and loss of human life that would be unacceptable to the ODP. To reduce the probability of an oil spill and to guard against this worst-case scenario, strict precautions to ensure off-structure, minimal-risk drilling are implemented. A discussion of the probability of a spill and the resulting fate and effects of oil in the marine environment are presented below.

Oil Spill Risk Analysis

The risk of future oil spills from scientific drilling in the ODP has been estimated using three basic assumptions:

    - Realistic estimates of future oil spill and blowout frequencies 
      can be calculated from past outer continental shelf (OCS) 
      drilling experience.

    - Oil spill and blowout rates are dependent on the number 
      of wells drilled (the exposure variable)

    - Estimates of risk are conservatively high because of the 
      "off-structure" drilling policy and site review of the ODP.

Many factors influence estimated oil spill and blowout rates, including the historical database, the exposure variable selected, and the drilling area used in the analysis. The historical database used herein covers exploratory and development drilling on the federal outer continental shelf from 1971 to 1982. Since production wells are drilled into known structures containing reservoirs that have previously been drilled, those statistics are not appropriate for use in an estimation of risk for ODP activities. Some data are available for drilling activities as early as 1950, but complete statistics separating exploratory and production drilling activities are not available for the years before 1971 (Minerals Management Service 1983b).

The exposure variable selected for this analysis was the number of wells drilled per unit time. Other exposure variables used in OCS lease sale areas (e.g., volume of flowthrough) were not appropriate for assessing the risks of scientific drilling activity.

Drilling sites chosen for the ODP will be carefully selected to minimize the chances of encountering hydrocarbon reservoirs. During the DSDP's 15 years of riserless drilling, 1,102 separate wells were drilled without a drilling-related mishap, blowout, or pollution incident (Pommerville 1984). In the ODP, the best available geological and geophysical data will be used to survey all prospective sites, and an intensive safety review

193
will eliminate all sites with apparent risk.  This safety review, discussed 
in detail later in this chapter, will be performed by two separate panels 
of geological, geophysical, and drilling industry experts.  Each panel 
will have the authority to recommend removal of a particular site due to 
the potential of encountering overpressure zones or hydrocarbon accumulations, 
or to the lack of sufficient information to determine such potential. 
Because selected ODP drilling areas of unlikely to overlie hydrocarbon 
reservoirs, the use (in this analysis) of historical spill statistics generated 
by oil-related drilling should yield conservatively high projected oil 
spill and blowout rates for ODP activities.

From 1971 to 1982, approximately 11,564 exploratory or development 
wells were drilled on the U.S. outer continental shelf.  During this time, 
47 drilling-associated blowouts were reported (Minerals Management Service 
1983b).  Using these data, the historical blowout rate for OCS activity 
is calculated to be 4.1 blowouts/1,000 wells drilled. Oil spills 1 barrel 
(bbl) or greater did not occur at any of these 47 blowouts (Minerals Management 
Service 1983b).  Therefore, the historical oil spill rate for spills greater 
than 1 bbl (based on exploration drilling activity from 1971 through 1982) 
is calculated to approach zero. All OCS oil spills have been related to 
production activities.

Both the blowout rate and the spill rate should represent conservatively 
high estimates for the ODP because the historical drilling activity used 
to calculate these rates was geared towards finding oil. Even industrial 
exploratory drilling in regions likely to contain oil will encounter any 
accumulations less than 10 percent of the time.  The majority of the ODP 
program will employ riserless drilling, as did the DSDP.  Riser drilling 
in thicker sediments (as is typical of OCS activities), may occur only 
during the latter stages of the ODP.  Riser drilling sites will undergo 
a site safety review process at least as rigorous as that for the riserless 
drill sites.

Based on the foregoing considerations, it is reasonable to assume 
that the risk of a blowout during the ODP will be substantially less than 
the rate encountered during OCS drilling activities (4.1 blowouts/1,000 wells). 
At projected ODP drilling rates, this approaches a probability of 0.1 blow-
outs/year.  The oil spill occurrence rate for spills greater than 1 bbl 
should be near zero.  In summary, because of the ODP site selection process 
and "off-structure" drilling policy, it is highly unlikely that oil will 
be encountered.  If encountered, it is highly unlikely that oil will be 
spilled in substantial volumes.

Fate of Crude Oil in the Marine Environment

The fate of spilled oil in the marine environment can be affected 
by many physical, chemical, and biological processes.  Short-term alteration, 
or weathering, begins as soon as oil enters the environment and generally 
lasts 1-2 days. Hydrocarbon fractions with boiling points above 250-3000 C 
are lost during this time (Council on Enviromental Quality 1974).  Weathering 
is dominated by physical and chemical processes (e.g., spreading, evaporation, 
dissolution, emulsification, dispersion, sedimentation, and auto-oxidation), 
whereas long-term breakdown is largely accomplished by microorganisms. 
These processes are described in detail in Appendix B.

194
The movement of spilled oil is influenced by the complex interaction
of wind-wave induced currents, tidal currents, and residual currents.
A schematic example of the transport, dispersion, and weathering of a hypo-
thetical oil spill was prepared by Mackay and Leironen (1977).  The model
simulates oil slick evaporation, dissolution, spreading, horizontal diffusion
in the water column, vertical diffusion in the water column, and natural
and chemically induced dispersion.  Model users may vary oil composition,
sea state, wind speed, temperature, and time of chemically induced dispersion.
The oil used in their simulation represented a "typical" natural crude oil
(Mackay and Leironen 1977).  Additional assumptions were: volume of
spill equals 900 bbl (120 tons); oil density equals 0.8575 g/cm^(3) (API gravity
33.5); water temperature equals 15^(0) C; wind speed equals 18 kn; sea state
is medium (4); and the initial spill radius is approximately 50 m (164 ft).
Results of the model calculations are given in Figure 50 for slick radius
vs. time and in Figure 51 for oil volume reduction vs. time.  Calculations
ended after 100 h, or about 4 days.

According to this model run, the slick reached a radius of approximately
1,000 m (3,281 ft) and only 15 percent of the original spilled volume remained
in the slick after 100 h or 4 days.  These results suggest that evaporation
and dispersion substantially reduce oil volumes within a very short time
period.  Since most ODP drilling locations will be at least 322-644 km
(200-400 mi) from shore, these natural processes will operate over large
distances and will greatly reduce the potential for impacts to shorelines
or impacts to resources (Pommerville 1984).  Assuming a spill occurs 322 km
(200 mi) offshore and travels directly to shore at a speed of 10 cm/sec
(4 in/sec), the spill (if still intact) would contact land in approximately
37 days.  After this length of time, significant reduction of volume and
weathering of the spilled oil should have taken place as described above.

Special Consideration: Sea Ice--

Oil/ice interactions are complex and incompletely understood.  The
fate of oil in high latitudes depends as much on location of the spill
as it does on time of year.  Oil slicks encountering open pack ice accumulates
in ice leads, where movement between the floes forces the oil onto the
edges and surfaces of the ice.  If oil is present during the open water
season and persists during ice formation, the heat flux from the oil plume
will maintain a hole in the ice throughout the winter (Wadhaus 1981).

Oil in pack ice is readily absorbed by both grease ice between floes
and coarse upper ice or snow layers on the floes themselves.  Once on the
surface of the ice, the oil may increase the rate of ice melting through
absorbtion of solar radiation.  Depending upon the season, the ice may
either continue to melt (carrying the oil as it moves) or refreeze and
immobilize the oil.  In either case, oil in pack ice may be transported
great distances before being released into the water.

Depending on bottom and mid-water currents, oil released from a blowout
occurring on the ocean floor could be transported underneath shelf ice
or flows.  When oil surfaces under fast ice, it becomes trapped in the
upper-most irregular pockets at the sea/ice interface (Clark and MacLeod
1977).  Oil trapped under ice will equilibrate at a minimum average thickness

of about 10 mm. Thus, even a spill of 200,000 bbl under smooth ice would spread over an area of only about 6 km2 (2.3 mi2) (Office of Marine Pollution Assessment 1982). Because sub-ice currents of greater than 0.2 m/sec (0.66 ft/sec or the speed required to cause oil to move under ice) are quite rare, the oil tends to remain stationary relative to the ice cover (Office of Marine Pollution Assessment 1982). During the winter season, freezing may encapsulate the oil. Encapsulation effectively traps the oil until the spring thaw, at which time it is released in a virtually unweathered state.

Oil under ice migrates upward at a rate proportional to the number of cracks, "wormholes," and brine channels. Oil under first-year ice migrates upward rapidly during the spring because of melting brine channels, whereas oil migration through multi-year ice is restricted by layers of refrozen melt water at the surface, and yearly ice accretion at the bottom. Oil trapped in first-year ice will likely be released by spring warming. This same process could take 2-3 years in multi-year ice. Because of the extremely low temperatures and the migration of high-latitude ice, entrapped oil tends to be released slowly over vast areas.

Biological Effects of Crude Oil

The biological impacts of crude oil in the marine environment may be chronic or acute, and may range from no observable effects to severe habitat destruction. The degree of impact depends on many factors, including the type of oil, the habitat characteristics, the dosage of oil, oceanographic and meteorological conditions, water turbidity, and the season (National Academy of Sciences 1975).

Biological responses that might accompany or follow an oil spill include:

  Death caused by lethal toxic effects

  Altered physiology or behavior caused by sublethal toxic effects

  Tainting due to uptake of oil

  Bioaccumulation or biomagnification

  Smothering and suffocation

  Habitat damage (Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution 1977).

The most toxic fractions of crude oil are the low molecular weight hydrocarbons, such as benzene and naphthalenes. These volatile fractions are also the most soluble. They may readily dissolve in the water column, but also tend to evaporate quickly, thereby limiting the amount of time they are in contact with biota. Non-volatile components of crude oils cause biological damage predominantly by coating and smothering organisms.

198
The following discussion is focused on the effects of crude oil on 
the major groups of marine organisms and major habitat types.  Marine mammals 
are also discussed in detail in Appendix A.

Organism Impacts--

Phytoplankton--Due to drastic fluctuations in species dominance in 
planktonic communities, it is very difficult to determine the effects of 
oil on species composition and abundance. Impacts may vary greatly, depending 
on the extent and duration of the spill and on the state of phytoplankton 
growth at the time of contact with the oil. Experiments on the toxic responses 
of phytoplankton to oil and oil fractions have yielded results ranging 
from lethal toxicity to growth stimulation. In general, toxic effects 
can be seen at concentrations (of soluble aromatics) of 10-100 ppm (Council 
on Environmental Quality 1974). Although oil may be toxic to individual 
phytoplankters, they are so prolific that the effects of spills would likely 
last only as long as oil fractions are present at toxic concentrations 
(Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution 1977).

Zooplankton--Zooplankton includes holoplankton (i.e., permanent zooplank-
ton), and meroplankton (i.e., eggs and larval stages of nektonic and benthic 
creatures).  Although copepods are the most studied holoplankters, information 
about the effects of oil on these organisms is inconclusive. Copepods 
are known to ingest oil droplets (the size of their natural food), which 
pass through their gut virtually unmodified (Teal and Howarth 1984).  In 
one nearshore spill of heavy refined oil, zooplankton densities near the spill 
site were depressed during the first 5 days of the spill. However, 
it is not known whether this was due to mortality or their avoidance of 
the area (Teal and Howarth 1984).

In general, larvae are 10-100 times more susceptible to soluble aromatics 
than are the adult stages of the same organisms. Because soluble aromatics 
do not persist in the water column, adverse impacts on larval and adult 
forms are likely to be short-term and localized.

Fishes and Fisheries--In most cases, adult fish will only encounter 
lethal concentrations of oil or dissolved aromatics in the immediate vicinity 
of a spill. Where large fish mortalities have been observed near crude 
oil spills, the deaths seem to have been caused by dispersants rather than 
by the oil itself.

The toxicity of crude oil to eggs, larvae, and juveniles probably 
poses a greater threat to fishes and fisheries than does the toxicity of 
crude oil to adult fishes. Typical lethal toxicities of soluble aromatics 
to eggs, larvae, and juveniles are in the range of 0.1-1.0 ppm, with larvae 
tending to be more sensitive than eggs (Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
1973). Mortality usually occurs as a result of abnormal development that 
renders the organism more vulnerable to predation or less successful at 
competition.

Benthic and Intertidal Organisms--Organisms inhabiting benthic or 
intertidal areas are usually highly impacted by nearshore spills.  Oil 
washed ashore may coat intertidal habitats, while oil that is in suspension 
or that settles out of the water may become readily incorporated into bottom

199
sediments. Because intertidal organisms are important components of marine 
ecosystems and often have economic value, impacts to intertidal areas have 
far-reaching consequences. Members of the benthos and intertidal communities 
include algae, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes, coelenterates, 
and hydroids. Intertidal organisms that live on hard substrate (mussels, 
oysters, barnacles, macroalgae) are vulnerable to the effects of oil coating. 
The filter feeders are vulnerable to oil suspensions and dissolved hydrocar-
bons. Intertidal and subtidal organisms that live on or in soft substrates 
are vulnerable to oil coating, sediment incorporation, and dissolved hydro-
carbons. Because oil can become closely associated with sediment, animals 
that are merely attached to the substrate tend to be less affected than 
those that live in the sediments or feed on them.

Microbes--Bacteria, yeasts, and molds transform liquid, gaseous, and 
solid hydrocarbons into more soluble and usually more reactive compounds. 
These compounds are in turn acted upon by other microorganisms, although 
no one species can utilize all the components of petroleum. Microbial 
populations respond to oil in two ways: naturally occuring bacterial popula-
tions are inhibited and petroleum-degrading bacterial populations are enhanced. 
An oil spill will induce a succession of dominant species as the oil is 
degraded. However, the mechanisms for this are not well known (Karrick 1977). 
Microbial populations in the sediment and in the water column in areas 
of chronic oil pollution often contain large numbers of oil-degrading bacteria.

Macroscopic Algae--Macroscopic algae are susceptible to coating by 
oil and to the toxicities of dissolved petroleum fractions. Sensitivities 
vary considerably among species. Spilled crude at Santa Barbara, California, 
caused little or no damage to three species of green algae, one species 
of brown algae, and kelp, but killed red algae. Some algae (such as kelp) 
secrete mucus, which provides protection against coating by oil (Council 
on Environmental Quality 1974). Estimated lethal toxicity ranges for algae 
are 0.1-1.0 ppm of dissolved aromatics (Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
1973).

Marine Grasses--Damage to marine grasses is usually caused by coating. 
However, weathered crudes are generally less toxic to marine grasses than 
are fresh crudes. The severity of effects from a spill is highly dependent 
on time of year, environmental conditions, type and condition of oil, and 
duration of exposure. Observed effects of oil spills range from little 
or no damage to nearly complete mortality. Following the AMOCO CADIZ spill, 
eelgrass suffered little or no adverse impacts (den Hartog and Jacobs 1980; 
Jacobs 1980). In contrast, surf grasses and salt marsh grasses suffered 
heavy losses (75-100 percent) in the Santa Barbara and Milford Haven incidents 
(Council on Environmental Quality 1974).

Special Consideration: Marine Mammals and Birds--As individuals, 
all marine mammals are vulnerable in various degrees to impacts resulting 
from an oil spill. However, the potential impact to a marine mammal population 
is dramatically increased when the population is confined to a specific 
area (e.g., breeding grounds, localized ranges). In addition, the population 
size is also a major factor affecting vulnerability of marine mammals to 
oil spills. Consequently, remnant and site-tenacious populations are more 
vulnerable to perturbations than are other more numerous or dispersed species.

200
Oil effects vary among species. Ecological characteristics that are 
most vulnerable to impacts include means of thermal regulation, site tenacity 
or timing of migration, preferred habitat, breeding system, foraging technique, 
and population size. Detailed evaluation on these impacts is presented 
in Appendix A. Species considered the most susceptible to population-level 
impacts include otters, fur seals, sereniads, monk seals, sea lions, and 
migratory baleen whales. Ecological effects are longer lasting for marine 
mammals than for other marine organisms due to relatively low mammalian 
reproductive rates. The most effective way to prevent adverse impacts 
is to avoid drilling during periods of maximum vulnerability (e.g., molting, 
breeding, pupping, migration).

The likelihood that an individual bird will suffer impacts of oiling 
depends on a number of behavioral factors (e.g., whether a bird spends 
all its time in the water, how it forages, and how it reacts to distur-
bance). The liklihood that a species will suffer impacts depends on factors 
like size and concentration of its world population, reproductive capability, 
and how gregarious it is (See Manuwal et al. 1979).  Lower bird densities 
found in the tropics (Ainley unpublished manuscript) reduce vulnerability 
of a population, while greater densities and areas of concentration (e.g., 
nesting colonies, rich foraging areas) increase vulnerability significantly. 
Most bird concentrations (and increased periods of vulnerability) are related 
to seasonal breeding or foraging locations, although certain areas (e.g., 
Galapagos Islands) have several endemic and small populations year-round. 
The duration of an oil spill perturbation would also affect the extent 
of impacts on bird populations. Species of concern include those listed 
in the Red Data Book (King 1981) as Endangered, Threatened, or Rare species 
for reasons of limited population size or range.

Penguin species are the most vulnerable to oiling, since they rely 
on their feathers for insulation. The alcids (e.g., mures, puffins), which 
spend almost all their time on the water, are also highly vulnerable. 
Diving birds (e.g., petrels, shearwaters, cormorants, boobies) also become 
oiled easily. Birds that forage along oceanic fronts (e.g., phalaropes) 
or exclusively in the ice pack (e.g., emperor and adelie penguins, antarctic 
and snow petrels), where oil may be concentrated, are subject to food web 
disruption and oiling. Many nearshore wintering species may be impacted 
if oil reaches shore.

Effects of oil on marine birds include mortality or disablement from 
fouling of their plumage, toxic effects, habitat loss, and food losses. 
Populations can take 50-100 years to recover from an oil spill (Wiens et 
al. 1978).

Impacts to Habitats--

Habitats are listed below in order of decreasing vulnerability to 
oil (ranking is based on relative impacts).  Both physical environment 
and species vulnerability have been considered (Johnson and Pastorok 1982). 
Biological descriptions of each habitat are presented in Johnson and Pastorok 
(1982).  It should be noted that particular habitats within each category 
vary widely due to geographical, physical, and biological factors.  Furthermore, 
the vulnerability of any given habitat might also vary seasonally.

201
Impacts of oil on organisms are often seen at the community level 
through several mechanisms:

  Selective elimination of species or functional groups that 
provide the resource base for higher trophic levels

  Disruption of detritus processing

  Selective elimination or depression of keystone predators 
or foundation species that control or dominate competitive 
interaction

  Sublethal impacts on physiology, growth, behavior, and repro-
duction of key species (Johnson and Pastorok 1982).

Salt Marshes--Salt marshes are perhaps the most oil-sensitive shoreline 
environments. Impacts occur mostly through direct contact of oil with 
surface-dwelling organisms, marsh plants, and substrate. The degree 
of oiling principally depends on the quantity of oil spilled and on the tidal 
level at the time of the spill. Because wave energy levels are low in 
marsh areas, spilled oil tends to disperse very slowly. Visual inspection 
of marshes 16 months after one spill revealed oil 5-10 mm (0.20-0.39 in) 
deep on the substrate, litter, and soil (Stebbins 1970).

Marsh vegetation provides structure and a detrital food base for the 
salt marsh community. Plant mortality, interference with detrital replenish-
ment, or contamination of detrital reservoirs could have long-term effects 
on community structure and overall production. Oiled detritus can be partic-
ularly damaging to detritivores and filter feeders. The sensitivity of 
marsh plants to oil varies. Effects include a reduction in flowering, 
seed production, germination, photosynthesis, transpiration, growth, water 
uptake, and oxygen diffusion; and changes in respiration and translocation 
(Johnson and Pastorok 1982).

Most investigations of saltwater marsh recovery focus on vegetation. 
Recovery times depend on the type of oil, extent of the oil coverage, and 
the season. Baker (1971) found that recovery of marshes occurred within 
1-2 years of oil spills in several locations, but that benthic populations 
required much longer periods. In lightly oiled areas of a spill at West 
Falmouth, Massachusetts, one species of crab showed considerable recovery 
after 4 years. In heavily oiled areas of the same spill, recovery of that 
crab did not begin for an additional 3 years (Krebbs and Burns 1977). 
The rate of recovery of benthic microfaunal populations in salt marshes 
is poorly known. These populations would be severely affected by patterns 
of vegetation regrowth.

Mangrove Forests--There are three sub-habitats in a mangrove community: 
supratidal canopy and trunk, intertidal prop roots, and subtidal substrate. 
The many components of each sub-habitat exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity 
to oil. Perhaps the most vulnerable are the epiphytes and those members 
of the food web that directly or indirectly depend on detritus as a food 
source. Grazers and filter feeders may also incur heavy mortalities from 
a spill.

202
The penetration of oil into a mangrove forest depends on tidal and wave influence, and on location and height of the shoreline berm.  Factors strongly influencing the fate and effects of petroleum include tidal and land surface drainage patterns.  Recovery of a mangrove forest from damage suffered through an oil spill depends primarily on the resident plant species. Fast-growing species may recolonize in as little as 8-10 years.  Other species may take 80 years or more to fully recover (Johnson and Pastorok 1982). Little information is available about the recovery of the rest of the mangrove community.

Coral Reefs--Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems of the world. The coral reef organisms provide a complex physical habitat for a large number of organisms.  Coral reefs form an extremely coarse and porous micro- and macro-topography that can readily trap and hold oil. The calcium carbonate sediments, which are formed by erosion of reefs, can retain oil for decades (Johnson and Pastorok 1982).  Coral reefs are highly sensitive to pollution stresses for three reasons: 1) reef organisms have narrow physiological tolerances, 2) key trophic interactions are easily disrupted, and 3) warmer temperatures enhance toxicity effects. Of the various reef zones, coral lagoons (within atolls) and intertidal reef flats are the most vulnerable to oil damage.  Johannes et al. (1972) demonstrated that corals directly exposed to oil at low tide suffered complete tissue breakdown.  Deeper reefs are considered less sensitive to oil damage, but may be adversely affected by sedimentation of fresh and weathered oil.

Recovery rates for impacted coral reefs depend on many physical, chemical, and biological factors.  Generally, recovery is fastest on reef crests, reef flats, and the shallow fore reef, and slowest in lagoons and deep fore reef zones.  After catastrophic destruction, reef recovery may take 30-40 years or more. Few studies have investigated the recovery of coral reefs after damage by oil spills.  However, Loya and Rinkevich (1980) reported that a chronically oiled reef had not returned to its original structure after 10 years.

Gravel and Cobble Beaches--Characteristics of gravel and cobble beaches vary with degree of exposure and particle size.  They may be classifed as exposed cobble beaches, exposed gravel beaches, sheltered cobble beaches, and sheltered gravel beaches.  Oil may rapidly penetrate cobble beaches and persist for years. Thus, cobble beaches may be impacted longer (more than 3 years) from an oil spill than are gravel habitats (Nyblade 1972).

Compared with eight other temperate marine habitats (on a decreasing scale of vulnerability), boulder, cobble, and gravel habitats rank fifth for susceptibility to the physical impacts of oil, and first for susceptibility to toxicity impacts of oil (DOE 1975).  Ecological succession is much more complex on cobble shores than it is on shores with gravel or mixed sediments. Therefore, biological recovery from an oil spill may be slower in the former area. There is little information on the recovery of gravel and cobble beaches after an oil spill.  However, Straughan (1978) noted partial recovery of fauna 2.5 years after the METULA incident.

Sandy Beaches and Tidal Flats--The slope of the beach, average particle size, and wave energy are usually positively related, and determine, to 

203
a large degree, the impact of an oil spill. Mechanical breakdown and dispersal
prevail in exposed environments. Thermal, biological, and chemical degradation
dominate in sheltered habitats.  In high wave-energy areas where sediment
transport is rapid, oil may become buried in zones of accretion, where
it can remain for a long period of time. However, in tidal flats where
wave energy is low, beached oil tends to stay on the surface.

Because the biological communities of sheltered sandy and muddy beaches
are detritus-based, they are very sensitive to the effects of oil contam-
ination. Among the inhabitants of these areas, soft-bodied organisms are
usually more susceptible than those with protective shells (Johnson and
Pastorok 1982). Because microcrustaceans in sand/mud flat areas provide
a stable food source for demersal fishes and shorebirds, these predators
may also be impacted by oil contamination.

As a very general rule, the ranking of biological recovery rates (from
fastest to slowest) for habitats in this category is: 1) exposed tidal
flats; 2) sheltered sandy beaches; and 3) sheltered tidal flats. Actual
recovery times largely depend on the persistence of the oil in the environment.
Initial studies of artificially oiled beaches indicated potential recovery
times of 31 months for protected sandy beaches and 46 months for tidal
flats (Vanderhorst et al. 1980, 1981).

Rocky Intertidal--The severity of oil spill impacts in rocky intertidal
areas generally increases as wave action decreases, because wave action
speeds weathering. The most vulnerable areas are protected embayments,
where oil may become stranded, and tide pools, which may act as natural
"catch basins" for contaminated waters.

Echinoderms, detritivorous microcrustaceans, and sessile invertebrates
are usually the most sensitive to oil contamination. Mass mortalities
of the less sensitive grazers may cause blooms of green algae.

Natural recovery rates for rocky intertidal areas range from 2 months
to more than 8 years. Recovery of macroflora and macrofauna after a severe
spill probably takes 5-10 years (Johnson and Pastorok 1982).

Rocky Subtidal--With the possible exception of deep subtidal areas,
oil will not tend to accumulate in rocky intertidal habitats because of
strong flushing and intense wave action. However, oil may become entrapped
in localized sediment pockets, where it can persist for several years before
being completely broken down and released.

Kelp is less sensitive to contamination by oil than are many other
inhabitants of the rocky subtidal habitat. For example, kelp grazers (e.g.,
sea urchins) and macroalgae other than kelp may be highly vulnerable to
contamination by oil. Mass mortality of these grazers in an open bottom
area may lead to extensive colonization by macroalgae.

Macroalgae and detritivores form the basis of rocky subtidal communities
in the north temperate zone (Johnson and Pastorok 1982). Contamination
of the detrital resource base, disruption of decomposition, or interference
with detrital replenishment from macroalgae could lead to extensive long-
term changes in food web structure or productivity. The recovery time

204
for the rocky subtidal habitat after an oil spill depends on many factors,
including: weather, type of oil, magnitude and duration of the spill,
and species of macroalgae which are present (annual or perennial).  For
kelp beds, several stable intermediate stages may be reached during recovery.
Complete recovery may take 50-100 years or more.

Seagrass Beds--Oil may reach seagrass beds in several ways: 1) sandy
oil from beaches may wash back; 2) emulsified oil may impinge on the bottom;
3) oil may undergo sedimentation and sink to the bottom; and 4) oil released
at the ocean floor may lead to direct contamination of sediments.  Soft-
bottom habitats are sensitive to oil contamination mainly because of their
low flushing potential. Oil may be bound to sediment particles and buried
in the sediment, where anaerobic conditions prevent rapid biodegradation.

Seagrasses are relatively insensitive to mild oil coating and to dissolved
aromatics, but mass mortality of seagrasses may have serious ecosystem
consequences. For example, eradication of seagrass in one area may cause
the destabilization of sediments, resulting in severe disturbances to the
benthic community. Within the sediments, oil would most severely impact
microcrustaceans, polychaetes, molluscs, and other detritivores. Gastro-
pods, bivalves and decapods may be less affected because of their heavy
shells. Impacts to benthic organisms would, in turn, affect organisms
at higher trophic levels (e.g., demersal fishes, shore-feeding birds, and
mammals) that prey on benthic populations. Recovery from moderate disturbances
to seagrass communities from oil may take several months to several years
(Johnson and Pastorok 1982). Complete recovery of a seriously disrupted
seagrass community may take a decade or more (Zieman 1975; Phillips 1978).

Pelagic Habitats--Rapid dispersion and weathering of oil in the open
water environment make pelagic habitats vulnerable to oil on a short time
scale. Open water food webs are based on phytoplankton which quickly recover
reduced biomass and primary production rates. Sublethal impacts to zooplankton
and pelagic fish could result from petroleum exposure and/or bioaccumulation.
Recruitment of ecologically and commercially important species may also
be affected, and could, depending on location, significantly impact an
entire year class.

There is little information regarding the impacts of oil on ice algae
communities. Mechanics of oil/ice interactions suggest that spilled oil
contacting ice could cover both bottom and top surfaces of the ice. Ice
algae would then be susceptible to both toxic effects of oil and shading
(Percy and Wells 1984). However, other ice-associated water column phyto-
plankton populations will probably be no more affected by spilled oil than
those in open waters (Percy and Wells 1984), reducing the impact on primary
production.

Special Consideration:  Antarctic Ice Edge Communities--Ice algae
blooms supply the earliest available food each year. This early food source
is important to krill (Euphasia superba), which is the food base for higher
predators such as fish, squid, seals and six species of whales (NSF 1979;
SCAR 1982).

Krill in the vicinity of an oil spill may be affected by a reduction
of food supply, direct toxicity, or coating. While local populations would

205
be affected, it is unlikely that even a very large oil spill (500,000 tons; 
over 3 million bbl, assuming a density of 0.9 g/cm3) would have much affect 
on overall krill production (Holdgate and Tinker 1979).

Recovery times for ice edge communities are largely unknown.  Because 
of the seasonal and transient nature of ice, oil would not persist in the 
same spot for long. However, if incorporated into permanent shelf ice, 
it could persist for years. Affects would be reduced because production 
in these areas is low. Impacts from a single event would probably be short-
lived and localized, as pack ice breakup and melting would disperse the 
oil over great distances.

Spill Prevention and Cleanup Techniques

The principal pollution hazard from scientific drilling is the possible 
release of gas and oil to the ocean or atmosphere. During ODP operations, 
it is particularly important both for pollution and safety considerations 
to avoid all encounters with or release of hydrocarbons.

Spill Prevention--

Spill prevention measures outlined in the ODP include:

  Selection of "safe" drill sites (minimal risk of encountering 
  hydrocarbon reservoirs)

  Proper planning of the drilling program at individual sites

  Early detection of hydrocarbons or high fluid pressures 
  during drilling 

  Procedures to cope with fluid flows encountered during drilling

  Procedures to abandon holes.

Preventive measures are outlined in detail in the Manual on Pollution Prevention 
and Safety (JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel 1976).

Spill prevention is realistically accomplished by reduction of the 
probability of encountering hydrocarbon accumulations. Even exploratory 
drilling by industry only has a 10 percent probability of encountering 
hydrocarbons. Scientific drilling is characterized by the avoidance of 
any potential regions of hydrocarbon encounter. The careful selection 
of drill sites is the single most important factor in spill prevention. 
Drilling sites selected for the ODP are carefully chosen to minimize the 
chance of encountering hydrocarbon reservoirs. During DSDP, 1,105 boreholes 
were drilled under this site selection procedure with no encounter of reser-
voired oil or gas. Extensive geological and geophysical data are required 
to survey all prospective sites, and an intensive safety review eliminates 
all sites with any apparent risk or inadequate information to determine 
such risk. This safety review is discussed in detail in Section 4.8.

Proper drilling program planning at each drill site can reduce the 
spill potential. Individual drilling programs include provisions for maximum

206
depth of penetration, a near-continuous coring program and a well-logging 
program [for all holes greater than 200 m (656 ft) deep].  In addition, 
during riser drilling, a mud logging program is designed for expected fracture 
gradients of each individual hole.

Monitoring of hydrocarbons during drilling aids in evaluating the 
spill potential prior to the encounter of substantial reservoirs.  The 
primary procedure for early detection of hydrocarbons is the prompt analysis 
of all cores (riser and riserless drilling) and drilling fluid samples 
(riser drilling) for signs of oil or gas.  Details of analyses, detection 
limits, and program protocol can be found in the Shipboard Organic Geochemistry 
Guide/Handbook (Simoneit 1981) and are discussed in Section 4.8.  Examination 
of cores can also reveal the presence of certain rock formations that could 
indicate the presence of hydrocarbons.  Cap rocks, undercompacted shales, 
clathrates, sulphur, evaporites, and other formations are warning signs 
of conditions favorable for hydrocarbon accumulations.  In addition, the 
drilling rate will be monitored, and temperature and pressures at the bottom 
of the hole will be determined.  Changes in drilling rate and bottom-hole 
pressures indicate changes in the formation.  Measurement of bottom-hole 
temperatures will allow detection of temperature gradients that are associated 
with hydrocarbon accumulations.

Procedures for preventing or coping with fluid flows include the use 
of heavy muds or a barite plug; care in pulling out of a hole to avoid 
a swabbing effect; use of conventional blowout preventers for riser drilling; 
and early abandonment and plugging of holes when unfavorable conditions 
are encountered. Comprehensive well control policies are outlined in the 
SEDCO Safety Policy Manual (SEDCO 1982), which all crew are trained to 
follow.

Safety measures for hole abandonment and plugging include the following:

  - All holes drilled in consolidated or semi-consolidated sediments 
    should be plugged with cement (or barite) to the uppermost 
    competent layer before abandonment.

  - All holes drilled in unconsolidated sediments in which oil 
    or gas are encountered should be filled with heavy mud before 
    abandonment.

  - Holes drilled beyond the continental margin in unconsolidated 
    sediments in which no oil or gas are encountered, or holes 
    in igneous rocks, may be abandoned without plugging.

Cleanup Options--

The various techniques available for containment, removal, or treatment 
of oil on the ocean surface include booms and skimmers, sorption, sinking, 
gelling and herding, chemical dispersal, burning, enhanced biodegradtion, 
and natural cleansing.  Current technology for recovering spilled oil is 
severely limited above sea state 3, in winds above 40 kn, in rapidly moving 
ice-bearing waters, and at night.  Standard cleanup procedures for small 
spills in harbors are in place and will be employed.

207
Offshore Spills--Cleanup guidelines set by the European Petroleum 
Organization for spills in the open ocean or rough seas [greater than 1 
km (3.2 mi) from shore] are summarized in Table 25.  For offshore oil spills, 
natural cleansing is the preferred cleanup option. Natural dispersion 
of oil in conjunction with mechanical recovery techniques are favored over 
other methods when potential for landfall or significant impact to resources 
is low.

Nearshore Spills--Cleanup guidelines set by the European Petroleum 
Organization for spills in nearshore waters [less than 1 km (3.2 mi) from 
shore] are summarized in Table 26.  Booms and skimmers are generally more 
efficient in nearshore waters than in offshore areas and are the favored 
cleanup method for fresh oil spills. Sorption techniques can aid in mechanical 
recovery activities but may be impractical in rough seas. Use of chemical 
dispersants in shallow water is not generally recommended due to potential 
ecological hazards. Chemical dispersal may be favored in deep, nearshore 
waters where there is a high risk of oil stranding on the shoreline.

Contingency Planning--

The spill continency plan outlines procedures to follow in the event 
of a spill. Duties and areas of responsibility are explicitly assigned 
so that all persons know their jobs in an emergency. Procedures described 
in the contingency plan include:

•   Discovery and notification of appropriate authorities

•   Safety measures

•   Containment and countermeasures

•   Cleanup and disposal

•   Restoration.

Planning and response will depend primarily on location of the drill 
site.  In situations outside of a 200-mi EEZ, probability of landfall of 
a spill is negligable and contingency planning is distinctly different 
than for drill sites within a country's jurisdiction.  In international 
waters, planning and response is strictly within the ODP.  Contingency 
planning as required by a specific country is defined before drilling within 
an EEZ.  If a spill moves from one jurisdiction to another, the authority 
to initiate pollution control measures shall shift as appropriate.  If 
a spill affects waters controlled by two different nations, both contingency 
plans will be activated and pollution control measures will be fully coordi-
nated.

Contingency planning for drill sites within U.S. jurisdiction is presented 
as an example.  The National Contingency Plan (40 CFR Part 1510; revised 
FR 12 Feb 85) applies to the navigable waters of the U.S., the adjoining 
shorelines, and the water of the continental shelf.  Responsibility of 
the various Federal agencies involved are delineated in the plan, providing 
a framework for a coordinated Federal response.  The National Strike Force 
(formed around U.S. Coast Guard Strike Teams, one each on the east, west,

SECTION 4.8
MITIGATING MEASURES INCLUDED IN ODP

Throughout ODP planning and implementation, the program participants will enact measures to prevent mishaps and accidents. Measures will also be investigated to mitigate the environmental impacts of accidents should they happen. This section describes program components that contribute to preventing accidents and mitigating adverse impacts.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS

A number of laws and regulations apply to the ODP, particularly to ship conversion and operation. Adherence to these statutes is a primary factor in preventing and mitigating situations with potential for causing significant adverse environmental impacts. A description of the laws and regulations that apply to the ODP have been previously addressed in Section 2.2, and are summarized in Table 27.

INSPECTION PROGRAMS

The ODP drillship is subject to inspection provisions of the International Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) and MARPOL 73/78 as delineated in Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular No. 8-83 (U.S. Coast Guard 1983). The U.S. Coast Guard has the responsibility to ensure that foreign ships entering U.S. navigable waters comply with the applicable provisions of MARPOL 73/78. The ship must have on board documentary evidence that it is designed and equipped to comply with all applicable requirements of MARPOL 73/78, including an International Oil Prevention Certificate. The ship is expected to maintain and must be able to produce an Oil Record Book and the recordings from a cargo and/or bilge monitor.

U.S. Coast Guard officials conducting ship inspections will use as guidance the "Procedures for the Control of Ships and Discharges" of MARPOL 73/78. If the Coast Guard determines that the condition of the ship or its equipment presents an unreasonable threat to the marine environment, the Coast Guard will ensure that immediate corrective actions are taken before the ship is allowed to put to sea.

OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND PROCEDURES

Procedures are included in the ODP planning process to prevent and mitigate environmental impacts, as summarized in this section.

Pre-Drilling Surveys

Detailed seismic profiling surveys are conducted before the commencement of drilling operations. These surveys are used to select drill sites away from locations with potential to contain hydrocarbon accumulations or areas

of abnormal pressures and geologic hazards.  The surveys also provide the 
data and information necessary to plan environmentally safe well programs.

Site Reviews

From the recommendations of the JOIDES Planning Committee, a number 
of drill sites are proposed on the basis of existing geological and geophysical 
data, and are supported by the dedicated site surveys mentioned above. 
These data are reviewed by the JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel 
(PPSP) through a clearly defined procedure in the Manual on Pollution-Prevention 
and Safety (JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel 1976).  The panel 
is composed of petroleum geologists, geophysicists, and organic geochemists 
drawn from industry, government, and academia who are recognized authorities 
in the fields of marine research and offshore oil exploration.  Several 
members of the DSDP PPSP are members of the new panel.  To eliminate any 
conflict of interest, panel members are not active participants in the 
drilling program and have no personal interest in seeing any particular 
site drilled.

The panel reviews the geological and geophysical data assembled by 
the scientists who proposed the drilling sites.  If sufficient, high quality 
data are not available to reliably evaluate site safety and the potential 
presence of hydrocarbons, the site is automatically disapproved.  The panel 
also thoroughly evaluates each proposed log by reviewing plans for each 
site, methods to anticipate hydrocarbons or high fluid pressures during 
drilling, measures to cope with flows of fluids anticipated during drilling, 
and measures to abandon holes.  Important factors considered in the site 
selection process include:

•  Thickness and character of underlying rock strata
•  Structural attitude and probability of trap features
•  Known oil and gas occurrences
•  Abnormal pressures
•  High geothermal gradient
•  Water depth
•  Significance of clathrates to safety of drill sites
•  Weather.

On the basis of panel findings, proposed sites are rejected if deemed 
unsafe (anything greater than minimal risk).  Alternatively, operating 
conditions are imposed to ensure reasonable pollution prevention and safety. 
An example of restrictions in operations at a specific drill site are the 
conditional limits on drilling when clathrates could be encountered.  Because 
the calculated thickness of the clathrate zone may be in error on complex, 
compressive margins, drilling must be stopped when clathrates are recovered 
at a site where there is no Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) on the seismic 
record by which to determine the hydrate base.  When a BSR indicates 

214
depth of the base, coring with the Pressure Core Barrel and a strict hydrocarbon 
monitoring program are required. Drilling is required to stop immediately 
if: 1) cores obtained with the Pressure Core Barrel confirm the presence 
of methane hydrate, or contain measured volumes of gas greater than 80 
times the volume of sediment; 2) the Pressure Core Barrel fails to function, 
but regular coring shows greater than normal amounts of hydrocarbons or 
indicates the presence of methane hydrate; or 3) coring yields evidence 
of hydrated gas, and bottom hole temperatures and pressures approach values 
at which gas hydrates change to free gas. This type of conditional drilling 
restrictions tailors the general safety policies of the ODP to the individual 
hole. Through this site-by-site review by the PPSP, the ODP reduces to 
minimal risk the potential of encountering conditions that may result in 
impacts to the environment.

As an added factor in the review system, the ODP science operator 
utilizes a separate group of safety advisors to evaluate those sites approved 
by the PPSP for each cruise leg (TAMU Safety Review Committee). Three 
exploration geologists with extensive knowledge of worldwide petroleum 
occurrences and years of experience serve on a voluntary basis. They review 
each proposed site and report their conclusion and advice separately to 
the ODP science operator. This advice is considered in the final decision 
of whether or not to drill the sites approved by the PPSP. This redundancy 
places the most conservative interpretation of degree of risk involved 
at any site drilled. After this safety review, a final cruise plan is 
assembled and distributed. It describes each site, defines its objectives, 
and outlines the drilling plan.

Well Planning

As described earlier in the EIS, well planning is the process whereby 
the procedures and programs to be used for each hole are determined.  This 
activity will take place after sites have been chosen for their scientific 
merit and have been evaluated for pollution prevention and operational 
safety. During the process of planning each well, the ODP science operator 
specifies details in the various programs that together constitute the 
drilling operations at a site. This includes determining casing sizes 
to be used and the depths to which they shall extend (casing program), 
drill bit type and size (bit program), types and amounts of cements used 
to seat the casing (cementing program), mud weights and characteristics 
(mud program), and circulation velocities (hydraulics program).  Initial 
plans are made before drilling begins. Refinement of the plans by the 
shipboard drilling operations manager occurs on site as additional data 
are received and evaluated.

On-Site Monitoring

Extensive data gathering occurs on board ship during drilling operations. 
Many of these are surface measurements to ensure that systems are operating 
as designed. Sensors provide data on the drill string, including the primary 
stresses that it is bearing, the running speeds, rate of penetration, and 
total depth drilled. Additional information is received on the drilling 
mud (riser drilling), including flow rate densities entering and exiting 
the hole, and volume. Information is also gathered on the formations 
to determine presence of gas or hydrocarbons and the nature of the formations.

215
Downhole logging tools provide additional data on conditions at the bit 
and in situ formation characteristics.

The monitoring of hydrocarbons in retrieved cores is one of the most 
important on-site mitigating procedures.  Off-structure drilling effectively 
eliminates the potential of encountering substantial accumulations.  However, 
small pockets of gas or areas of "dead oil" (where past migrations of oil 
through a formation have left the longer chain hydrocarbons) may not be 
detectable on the seismic record.  Monitoring the rate of change of the 
methane/ethane ratio (gas accumulations) and C5-C40 hydrocarbons (oil) 
can give early indications that the hole may be approaching an accumulation. 
The ODP enforces strict monitoring of rates of change and total concen-
trations for both parameters.  If safe limits are exceeded, drilling terminates 
and the hole is plugged and abandoned.  Slight changes in methods and equipment 
from those detailed in the Shipboard Organic Geochemistry Guide/Handbook 
(Simoneit 1981) allow lower detection limits and better precision, resulting 
in greater ability to detect hydrocarbon gradients that could indicate 
an accumulation.

Surface and downhole measurements during drilling operations provide 
valuable data to ensure against mishaps or accidents.  If abnormalities 
are encountered during the course of drilling, corrective or mitigative 
procedures are employed to assure safety of the ship, the crew, and the 
environment.

CONTINGENCY PLANNING

The objective of contingency planning is to restore normal operations 
quickly and efficiently in the event of emergency.  Personnel are trained 
to understand and implement proper procedures for handling the various 
emergencies that might occur during drilling operations.  Primary consideration 
is given to personnel safety, minimizing environmental impacts, and to 
protection of equipment.  Contingency planning has been done in several 
areas: ice encounter, well control, blowout without riser in place, blowout 
following discussion addresses all of the above, except for petroleum spill 
contingency planning, which is discussed in Section 4.7.

Ice Encounter

SEDCO has established zones around the drillship, based on the degree 
of danger associated with icebergs, to eliminate ice encounter while drilling. 
All icebergs are charted by radar within 25 nmi of the ship.  On the basis 
of time of projected encounter and distance from ship, successive zones 
are established that will allow sufficient time to safely suspend operations, 
to move off site, or to abandon the hole if necessary.

Well Control

SEDCO has comprehensive well control policies with which all personnel 
must comply.  The SEDCO Safety Policy Manual (SEDCO 1982) consists of their 
own specifc policies and procedures, well as those of the International 
Association of Drilling Contractors Accident Prevention Manual, which is 
the standard for the drilling industry.  Well control planning utilizes

216
all available data to anticipate problems and to prepare a drilling prognosis.
The prognosis reflects the best available methods to overcome or eliminate
these problems safely and efficiently.  The primary well control measure
is careful use of drilling mud and mud circulation rate to control pressures
exerted against formations and high formation fluid pressures.  Secondary
control is provided through the use of blowout preventers.

Blowout without Riser in Place

The primary means of controlling a well without a riser is to use
weighted muds. Early warning of a kick provides the best means of successfully
controlling this condition. Warning signs include evidence of hydrocarbons
in cores, increased drilling rate, increased pump speed and decreased pump
pressure, decrease in drill string weight, data from hole logging, televiewer,
or other measurements while drilling. Upon detection, a kick can be controlled
with heavy mud, barite pills, and cement.  This usually signals the end
of drilling at that particular site.

Blowout with Riser in Place

Indicators of a kick under riser conditions include those mentioned
above for riserless conditions and the following:  increase in mud flow
returns; increase in mud volume; flow with pump off; gas, oil, or water
cut mud; change in mud chlorides; change in shale density; temperature
increase at flow line; change in cuttings; paleontology correlation; rotary
torque increases; and loss of returns.

A blowout with the riser in place can be more dangerous to shipboard
personnel than one without a riser because the discharge can occur at or
very near the rig floor. The contingency plan contains procedures for
reacting to a wide range of emergency conditions.  Loss of control of the
well under riser conditions could develop from any one of a number of condi-
tions, including failure of the BOPs, failure in the choke and kill system,
broaching of the seafloor outside the wellhead, collapse of the riser,
loss of the wellhead, or loss of power and controls at a critical time.
If a blowout occurred, control would be attempted through procedures outlined
in the contingency plans specific to that condition.

Presence of Hydrogen Sulfide

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic gas that is often present in offshore
formations.  If any H2S is encountered, considering the limited amount
of possible safety areas for rig personnel, the hole will be abandoned
for safety.  Upon encountering H2S, drilling or coring operations are to
be suspended immediately and efforts taken to preserve the safety of the
crew.  Cement is to be pumped downhole to shut off the H2S influx, and
the well abandoned in an accepted industry manner as soon as possible.

217
SECTION 4.9
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USE AND MAINTENANCE
AND ENHANCEMENT OF LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY

The short-term use of the environment consists of scientific study
in the following subject areas: tectonics of the ocean basins, the generation
and destruction of ocean crust, paleoclimatology, paleontology, and paleocean-
ography. In addition, scientific investigations of thick sedimentary sequences
are focused on the history of the margins themselves; the erosion of the
adjacent continents; and the deposition, thermal history, and chemistry
of the sediments. These activities provide unique study opportunities
for a variety of sciences.

The proposed action may result in short-term impacts to the physical
environment involving marine water quality and acoustics. Drilling muds
and cuttings would adversely affect local water quality. Drillship movement
and drilling operations would increase local noise levels temporarily.

Short-term effects on marine biological communities could result from
normal operations. Minor losses would occur in biological productivity
and marine habitats. Endangered species and biologically-sensitive areas
would not be seriously affected as a result of the proposed action.

Short-term effects on other uses of the environment could occur.
Limited preclusion of commercial fisheries, military activities, and transpor-
tation would be associated with the proposed action.

If an oil spill occurs, longer-term impacts could occur involving
reductions in biological productivity, changes in marine habitats, reductions
in biological populations, and modifications of the food web. The marine
environment is expected to return to pre-spill levels of productivity.

The goals of the ODP do not present a conflict between the short-term
and long-term uses of the environment. In fact, the program's goal is
to advance our understanding of the earth by adding to two aspects of long-
term productivity: scientific information and data that may lead to future
resource development. Understanding the nature and evolution of the earth's
crust and its state of stress in various tectonic settings could contribute
to better predictions of major natural geologic hazards (e.g., earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions). Insight into the natural variability of long-term
climatic changes and into the ocean's role in those changes may be gained
by seafloor exploration. Improved knowledge of the ocean floors can provide
a sound scientific basis for the evaluation of potential hydrocarbon and
other mineral resources beyond the continental shelf.

312
Storage of the retrieved cores in a repository for future study reduces 
future effects on the marine environment, thus enhancing long-term produc-
tivity.  As scientific discoveries lead to new questions in marine geology, 
further analyses of the stored samples obtained during the DSDP and the 
ODP can answer these questions and reduce the need to obtain new samples, 
thereby further reducing impact to the environment.

                                                                 219
SECTION 4.10
IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES

HUMAN RESOURCES

It is impossible to avoid all human casualties, but they will be minimized
through safety precautions, on board training, and maintenance of excellent
crew facilities. Fatalities and/or permanent impairment as a consequence
of accidents and personnel error represent, of course, an irreversible
and irretrievable commitment of human resources. Moreover, the efforts
of the skilled personnel involved will redirect the knowledge and labor
of the personnel from other related research activities.

ECONOMIC RESOURCES

The total monetary cost of the ODP is an irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of economic resources. In addition, the drillship and supporting
equipment involved in the ODP are suitable for offshore oil and gas drilling
but will be unavailable for that purpose.

ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES

Fabrication of required metal products represents an irretrievable
commitment of resources. The ship's conversion provided scrap metal and
utilized additional materials. However, this commitment can be retrieved
in the future. Fuel expended to operate the ship represents an irretrievable
commitment of resources. Loss of the drill string or riser, various downhole
instruments, and wireline in the deep ocean would result in an irreversible,
irretrievable, and possibly catastrophic event (in the event of the loss
of the ship).

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

An irreversible or irretrievable commitment of biological resources
could occur in the event of a blowout of gas or oil. However, it might
be anticipated that once an area of the ocean recovered from a blowout,
the natural flora and fauna would reoccupy a vacated habitat.  In that
respect, the effect may be reversible.  If, on the other hand, the event
occurred in an area occupied by a population of an endemic endangered species
and caused severe losses, extinction of the species would have been ac-
celerated. This would probably not be easily reversed.

CHAPTER 5

CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION WITH OTHERS

221
Section 5.1
PREPARATION OF THE ODP PROPOSAL

Since 1957, the NSF has supported scientific deep-sea drilling through several projects. Project Mohole and post-Mohole studies, in part, received scientific advisory planning and guidance from JOIDES, a consortium comprised of major U.S. oceanographic institutions.  The Deep Sea Drilling Project, launched in 1968, continued to utilize the consortium for planning and guidance.  The International Phase of Ocean Drilling involved the expansion of JOIDES to include oceanographic institutions from the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the U.S.S.R.  In 1980-1981, the Ocean Margin Drilling Program was sponsored jointly by the NSF and a consortium of 10 major U.S. oil companies; when the oil companies withdrew support, the program was terminated.

Scientific plans for the Advanced Ocean Drilling Program (AODP) were formulated at the Conference on Scientific Ocean Drilling in November, 1981.  This program would have involved the extensive conversion and modification of the government owned ship, GLOMAR EXPLORER.  However, when preliminary designs were completed in November, 1982, it became apparent that costs would exceed budgetary limits.  Simultaneously, the charter rates for commercial drillships dropped dramatically and plans were formulated to charter a commercial vessel.  The NSF moved ahead on the revised project, with the shortened name of Ocean Drilling Program, and with the same scientific objectives, management plans, and budget as the AODP.

The United States, United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, Canada, and the European Science Foundation (composed of a consortium of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) are cooperating to organize and undertake the project.  Scientific planning for the ODP is provided primarily by the JOIDES inter-national scientific committee structure.  Primary management responsibility for the ODP resides with JOI.

222
Section 5.2
PREPARATION OF THE EIS

In its initial stage, the ODP continues scientific drilling operations 
similar to those carried out in the International Phase of Ocean Drilling 
of the DSDP. For such operations, the EIS prepared in 1975 for the IPOD 
still applies. However, in view of the expanded activitites under the ODP, 
the NSF decided to prepare this programmatic EIS. It addresses all possible 
types of drilling which could be undertaken over the expected life of the 
ODP.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRE-EIS SCOPING

A notice of intent was published in Federal Register 49(50):9512-9513, 
March 13, 1984. The NSF carried out a scoping process in accordance with 
NSF Regulations on Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 
The NSF contacted Federal agencies with relevant environmental jurisdiction 
or expertise to request input in identifying the range of actions, alternatives, 
and impacts to be considered in the EIS, in determining the scope of issues 
to be addressed, and in identifying the significant issues related to the 
proposed action. The agencies contacted included:

    U.S. Department of Commerce
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    U.S. Department of Defense
        Navy
    U.S. Department of Energy
    U.S. Department of the Interior
        Bureau of Land Management
        Fish and Wildlife Service
        Geological Survey
        Minerals Management Service
        National Marine Fisheries Service
        National Park Service
    U.S. Department of State
    U.S. Department of Transportation
        Coast Guard
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    Marine Mammals Commission

Information and comments received during the development of the proposal 
were used in preparation of the DEIS. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, formal consultation is taking place with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service and with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

LIFE HISTORY REQUIREMENTS

INTRODUCTION

Scientific drilling differs markedly from the petroleum industry drilling
in that its primary aim is to gain information about the geologic record
and is not directed towards potential oil resources. Consequently, there
is much less likelihood of adverse impacts on marine mammals individually
or on their population as a result of the greatly reduced potential of
direct contact with oil. Ecological characteristics used to evaluate a
species vulnerability to impacts include means of thermal regulation, site
tenacity or timing of migration, preferred habitat, breeding system, foraging
technique, and population size.

Some entire families are so reduced in numbers (e.g., Balaenidae and
Monachinae) that they could be easily disturbed by human intervention and
are protected by both the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the
Endangered Species Act of 1973. All marine mammals receive protection
in United States waters, but critical habitat for those that are listed
as endangered is also protected from destruction or modification.  In all,
there are 110 potentially vulnerable species considered that may be impacted
by operations of the ODP, of which only 16 are vulnerable to population
level impacts. To facilitate assessment of potential impacts, reviews
of impacts associated with scientific drilling were used to categorize
the major families of marine mammals based on their expected vulnerability
to the impacts (see Table 1). Distribution maps of each species are organized
taxonomically within the categories of vulnerability (see Figures 1 to
4d).

POTENTIAL IMPACTS

Potential impacts can be summarized under six categories:  1) acoustic,
2) noxious,  3) foraging,  4) respiratory,  5) reproductive, and 6) thermal.
All marine mammals may be affected by the first five impacts to varying
degrees. Thermal impacts, though crucial, will only be significant for
those species relying on fur for thermal regulation (otters, fur seals,
polar bears). In general, species that are site-tenacious or return to
specific habitats suffer increased risk of repeated exposure. It is important
to note that secondary impacts such as reproductive disorders may occur
as a result of stresses induced by any of the impacts.

Noise associated with most phases of scientific drilling is generated
by:  seismic surveying, drilling, air support, and ship support. Acoustic
impacts associated with shock waves generated during seismic surveys are
a threat to all marine mammals within critical range of the blast. However,
more recent applications of air guns reduces the possible severity of this
impact. Most studies of hearing loss due to cochlear damage have utilized

A-2
high frequency sounds (Raumprashad et al. 1973).  However, drilling operations 
are more likely to generate low-frequency disturbances which may result 
in stress-related problems or avoidance.  Stress-mediated reactions of 
birds and mammals to noise may reduce an organism's resistance to disease, 
increase its vulnerability to environmental disturbances, and create endocrine 
imbalances that affect reproduction (Fletcher 1971).  Most marine mammals 
use sound as a form of communication or for navigation and locating prey 
(Norris 1969).  Background noise may interfere with these basic processes, 
resulting in social disruption, decreased feeding efficiency, or disorientation 
due to echo confusion (Geraci and St. Aubin 1980).

Geraci and St. Aubin (1980) suggested that two types of noise may 
affect marine mammal behavior: impulse and chronic background noise. 
A sudden disturbance can cause pinnipeds to leave their rookeries (Salter 
1979).  Repeated disturbances can cause the abandonment of traditional 
breeding sites in favor of less suitable ones (Geraci and St. Aubin 1980). 
Cetaceans are also potentially affected adversely by increased boat traffic, 
which is thought to disturb migration routes (Nishiwaki and Sasao 1977) 
and breeding grounds (U.S. Department of Commerce 1983).  The groups most 
likely to be affected by noise disturbances are those confined to critical 
habitats (e.g., Sirenia and Monachinae), haul-outs (e.g., Pinnipedia), 
or breeding grounds (e.g., E. robustus and M. novaeangliae).  Displacement 
from critical habitats could cause dramatic alterations to their breeding 
success.  Pinnipeds most vulnerable to noise disturbance may include perinatal 
females, nursing pups, molting animals, and those stressed by parasitism 
or disease (Geraci and Smith 1979).  Cetaceans on their breeding grounds 
are also more vulnerable due to the stresses of lactation, which are often 
compounded by fasting.  Displacement from their breeding or feeding grounds 
may also result in reduced reproductive fitness of the population.

Noxious effects of oil spills common to all marine mammals include 
irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes, as documented in experimentally 
oiled ringed seals (Phoca hispada) (Geraci and Smith 1979).  Cetacean skin, 
though unlikely to accumulate oil, may be particularly sensitive to surface 
contact with oil due to the lack of a keratin layer in the epidermis (which 
is likened to the sensitivity of a mucous membrane) (Ling 1974).  Walrus 
and sireniad skin, though poorly studied, is thought to be similar in sensi-
tivity (King 1964).  Cetaceans in estuarine systems may have exaggerated 
skin sensitivity to surface contact with oil due to the low salinity of 
the environment.

The dependence of pinnipeds and otters on specific substrates during 
pupping, molting, and breeding activities may force them into repeated 
exposure to shoreline accumulations of oil, thereby increasing their vulner-
ability to noxious effects (Davis and Anderson 1976).  Smith and Geraci 
(1975) suggested that short-term inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons was 
not harmful to the respiratory tract of ringed seals experimentally immersed 
in oil-covered water for 24 hours. Prolonged inhalation is more likely 
to have greater consequences. Reactions to chronic exposure of petroleum 
vapors have been studied in rats and include central nervous system disturbance, 
bronchopneumonia, and death (Carpenter et al. 1978).

Marine mammals may ingest and accumulate oil from surface feeding 
(e.g., baleen whales), grooming (e.g., otters), or eating contaminated

A-3
prey. Crude oil density and viscosity increase with weathering due to 
evaporation of the volatile portions. The more viscous forms could foul 
baleen plates, rendering them ineffective as filters. Raw crude oil or 
lighter oil fractions have less fouling potential, but are volatile and 
destructive to tissue. Such fractions could also interfere with the functioning 
of baleen plates (Geraci and St. Aubin 1980). Ingested oil is potentially 
lethal resulting from acute cytotoxic damage (Moore and Dwyer 1974). Ringed 
seals and harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) rapidly absorbed crude oil hydro-
carbons into body tissues and fluids, but showed no immediate evidence 
of tissue damage (Englehart et al. 1977; Geraci and Smith 1976). Herbivorous 
Sirenia would probably suffer from ingestion of oil through effects on 
gut flora and secretory activity of the gastric glands, thereby interfering 
with digestion (Kenchington 1972).

Bioaccumulation of hydrocarbons through the food chain can be deleterious 
to all marine mammals. Benthic invertebrates accumulate aromatic hydrocarbons 
to varying degrees from seawater (Stegeman and Teal 1973) and from bottom 
sediments (Roesijadi et al. 1978). Generally, benthic and deposit feeders 
accumulate hydrocarbons to a greater extent than do suspension feeders 
(Geraci and St. Aubin 1980). The walrus (Odobenus spp.), bearded seal 
(Erignathus barbatus), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and otters would 
have elevated exposure to these impacts because of their benthic food prefer-
ences. The killer whale (Orcinus orca) has been shown to accumulate high 
levels of toxic substances in blubber (Calambokidis et al. 1984). The 
problems of bioaccumulation are probably common to all higher level predators 
(e.g., polar bear, leopard seal). Hodgins et al. (1977) provided evidence 
for the carcinogenic properties of petroleum hydrocarbons on invertebrate 
and vertebrate species.

However, even if the marine mammal is not directly killed by the ingestion 
or inhalation of petroleum, or starved from reduced feeding efficiency, 
the possibly deleterious secondary impacts on future reproductive success 
due to stresses associated with these impacts are critical to the impacts 
on the population.

There is strong evidence that animals which rely on fur or hair for 
insulation will be severely affected by surface contact with oil. Based 
on experiments with various species of pinnipeds and otters (Kooyman et 
al. 1977), organisms with a large blubber layer appeared to be less affected 
by thermal stress resulting from surface contact with oil than those relying 
on fur or hair. Experimentally oiled sea otters (Enhydra lutris) spent 
75 percent of their time trying to clean their pelage (Wi11iams 1978). 
This diversion from their normal behavioral repertoire will undoubtedly 
stress their energetic requirements because of increased work to stay warm 
with fouled pelage and diversion from foraging, which would be the only 
way to satisfy increased metabolic needs. Solvent-emulsifiers used to 
clean the pelage may cause additional problems due to detrimental effects 
resulting from excessive handling (Davis and Anderson 1976) or degradation 
of natural oils on their fur (Williams 1978). Therefore, drilling operations 
should take particular caution in the vicinity of populations of species 
that rely on fur or hair for thermal insulation.

A-4
POPULATION IMPACTS

Four general categories of vulnerability have been formulated based 
primarily on means of thermal regulation and site tenacity (Table 1). 
However, the size of a population is a major factor affecting its overall 
vulnerability to disturbances associated with the ODP, since the affect 
of an individual on a population increases as population declines.  Conse-
quently, the remnant populations of the Balaenidae family are more vulnerable 
to perturbation than some of the species in the family Delphinidae, even 
though Balaenidae is listed in a lower ranking category (Tables 1 and 2).

The species listed within each category in Table 1 (unless otherwise 
noted) are particularly vulnerable to population-level disturbances because 
of their reduced numbers. However, even though most of the species listed 
in Table 1 are endangered, not all can be considered equally vulnerable. 
The potential of the proposed project to dramatically impact an entire 
population is heightened if the impact occurs to a threatened population 
that is confined to an area of concentration (e.g., breeding ground or 
localized distribution range). Therefore, the consequences of the impact 
will affect a major proportion of the population. Consequently, the species 
selected from the families in each category are to be considered the most 
vulnerable to population-level impacts and will be reviewed with some detail 
so that their critical natural history requirements can be considered.

The species listed in category 1 in Table 1 are potentially the most 
vulnerable. They all rely on fur or hair for thermal regulation, are found 
in aggregations (except polar bear), and are reduced in population size 
(Figure 1, Table 2). The marine otter (Lutra felina) is highly vulnerable 
in its remnant range. Little is known about its movements or reproduction. 
The sea otter (Enhydra lutra) appears to be increasing in number in Alaska, 
but the stability of its existence along the California coast is still 
in question. It bears young in late spring to early summer, and depends 
on kelp forests for its survival. As a benthic feeder, it is also subject 
to long-term problems associated with bioaccumulation. The polar bear 
(Ursus maritimus) is never found in dense aggregations, but its close asso-
ciation with ice flows, where accidentally spilled oil may accumulate, 
deserves some attention. In addition, as a higher order predator, its 
vulnerability to disorders associated with bioaccumulation is heightened. 
The three most vulnerable fur seals to population impacts are the Galapagos 
fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis), which pups year round in the Galapagos 
Islands, the Juan Fernandez fur seal (A. philippi), which pups in December 
on the islands off the central coast of Chile, and the Guadalupe fur seal 
(A. townsendi), which begins to aggregate on Guadalupe Island in May (King 
1983). The Northern fur seal (Calorhynus ursinus), though not endangered, 
deserves consideration because of its confined breeding sites and recent 
population declines.

The endangered or threatened species that rely on blubber for thermal 
regulation and are site-tenacious are listed in category 2 (Table 1). 
These include all the Sirenia, the monk seals (monachus spp.), the Australian 
sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), Hooker's sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), and 
cochito (Phocoena sinus), the most recently declared endangered species 
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1985) (Table 2). The Sirenia are vulnerable 
to population impacts because of their restricted habitation, reduced population

size, acoustic sensitivity, and herbivorous diet which makes them more
prone to noxious effects of ingested oil (Kenchington 1972).  The Amazon
manatee (Trichechus inunguis) is sparsely distributed over the Amazon basin
(Figure 2a).  Its limited contact with the coast makes it the least vulnerable
of the Sirenia (Husar 1977).  The African manatee (T. senegalensis) is
distributed in rivers, estuaries, and coastal regions of West Africa from
Senegal to Angola (Figure 2a).  Its distribution is limited to waters of
18o C or higher and it apparently breeds year-round (Husar 1978b).  The
West Indian manatee (T. manatus) occurs throughout the year, but is confined
to short estrus periods.  They are susceptible to pneumonia and bronchial
disorders, but in Florida heavy boat traffic is believed to be the major
source of mortality. They seek refuges in the winter when water temperatures
fall below 15o C (Husar 1978c).  The dugong (Dugong dugong) is the only
living species of the family Dugongidae.  Its range includes the coastal
waters within the tropical and subtropical latitudes of the Indian and
Pacific oceans (Figure 2a).  They are most abundant in Africa along Kenya
and the Somali Republic, but the greatest concentrations appear in northern
Austrailian waters.  They are probably the most vulnerable of the Sireniads
because they do not ascend up rivers, but prefer sheltered waters of 2-8
fathoms with a temperature range of 21o-38o C (Husar 1978a).

The monk seals are all extremely threatened due to their inability
to coexist with human disturbances.  The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus
monachus) is most common in the eastern Aegean Sea, where pups are born
between September and October (Figure 2b) (King 1983).  The West Indian
monk seal (M. tropicalis) is possibly extinct, therefore no particular
areas of concentration can be cited (Figure 2b) (King 1983).  The Hawaiian
monk seal (M. schaunslandi) lives on the atolls of the leywand chain of
the Hawaiian Islands (Figure 2b).  They pup from March through May (King
1983).  Their continued decline has led NMFS to redesignate most of their
distribution as a critical habitat (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1985).

Two southern hemisphere sea lions are vulnerable to population impacts.
The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinera) is nonmigratory, with a distribution
restricted to southern Australia, and does not have a defined breeding
season (Figure 2c) (King 1983).  The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri)
also has a very restricted distribution (Figure 2c).  They congregate on
Enderby and Dundas Island in January to breed (King 1983).  Cochito, also
known as the Gulf of California harbor porpoise (Phocoena sinus) is only
found in the northern third of the Gulf of California (Figure 2d).  It
has been seriously depleted as a result of incidental takes in commercial
gillnets. No confirmed sightings have been reported since 1980 (U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service 1985).

Ranking vulnerability by potential impacts to individuals determines
the likelihood an organism is affected by an activity.  However, the wide
pelagic distributions of the marine mammals listed in categories 3 and
4 reduce the potential that a significant portion of a population will
be impacted; in effect, lowering that ranking.  The greatly reduced numbers
of the baleen whales (Table 2) due to extensive whaling increases the potential
that these species can be significantly impacted compared to other pelagically
distributed species.  The bowhead (Balaena mysticetus), right (Balaena
glacialis; B. australis), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and gray

whale (Eschichtius robustus) populations have regular migratory movements 
that render them vulnerable to major impacts when they are aggregated in 
high concentrations on their breeding grounds or along migration corridors.

There are four remnant populations of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) 
whose movements are somewhat confined by ice coverage (Figure 3).  The 
most abundant population is in the Canadian Arctic and moves from Banks 
Island and the Beaufort Sea in the summer, to the Chukchi Sea through the 
straits to the Bering Sea in the winter.  The second population is in the 
Sea of Okhotsk.  The third population moves between Baffin Bay and Hudson 
Bay in eastern Canada, traveling into the Labrador Sea in winter.  The 
smallest population occurs in the Greenland and Barents Seas, once their 
primary breeding grounds (Watson 1981).  The right whale (B. glacialis; 
B. australis) of the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, moves 
coastally towards the equator in the winter and to the poles in summer. 
B. glacialis can be observed in the Bay of Fundy from July through September. 
B. australis can be observed in Patagonia, Argentina from mid-July through 
November (Watson 1981).  All the members of the family Balaenidae are poten-
tially exposed to the impacts of baleen fouling due to their surface feeding 
techniques.

The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) travels approximately 13,000 mi 
between its breeding grounds and feeding areas (Figure 3).  In late September, 
after spending four months in the Chukchi and Bering Seas they begin to 
go south with pregnant female leading the way.  They travel along the west 
coast of the United States (Figure 3) and arrive in the lagoons of the Baja 
peninsula in late December.  They return north in February and are last seen 
from the Washington coast in May (Watson 1981).  Very little is known about 
the remnant west Pacific population.  The humpback whale (Megaptera novae-
angliae) population is composed of discrete stocks which feed in polar 
regions of both hemispheres and return to the tropics in the winter (Figure 3). 
Humpbacks can be seen in Hawaii from December to April, in the West Indies 
from January to March, and off Bermuda in April and May (Watson 1981).

While also listed in category 3, the populations of blue (Balaenoptera 
musculus; B. brevicaudia), fin (B. physalus), and sei whales (B. borealis), 
though endangered, are too widely distributed to incur any potential population 
impacts from ODP activities (Figure 3).  Species of the family Physeteridae 
are the only specific species listed in category 4 (Table 1).  It is not 
likely that any geographically specific event could significantly affect 
this globally distributed group (Figure 4a).  The wide distribution of 
the other pelagic toothed whale in category 4 (Figure 4b-4d) reduces to 
a negligible level the potential of population level impacts on these species.

SUMMARY

In summary, all marine mammals as individuals are potentially vulnerable 
to impacts from drilling and/or accidental oil spills.  They can be categorized 
into four general levels of vulnerability based primarily on their means 
of thermal regulation and site tenacity (Table 1).  These categories are 
necessarily general because of our limited understanding of the ramifications 
these impacts could have on the species in question.  Further research 
is needed to evaluate the behavioral and physiological responses exhibited 
by marine mammals encountering potentially disruptive human activities.

However, only those populations that are severely reduced in size and/or 
can be found in aggregations are vulnerable to population-level impacts 
as a result of combined impacts with other activities, which cumulatively 
affect their survival.  Those species considered susceptible to population 
impacts are listed under their taxonomic families within their respective 
categories of vulnerability (Table 1).  The otters and fur seals (Figure 
1), Sireniads (Figure 2a), monk seals (Figure 2b), sea lions (Figure 2c), 
and migratory baleen whales (Figure 3) listed in Table 1 are to be given 
the most consideration (e.g., accommodation of times of maximum vulnerability 
such as molting, breeding, pupping) when deciding location and timing of 
drilling sites.

PROCESSES AFFECTING WEATHERING AND CHEMICAL FATE
OF OIL IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

The fate of spilled oil can be affected by several processes: advection,
spreading, evaporation, dissolution, emulsification, dispersion, auto-oxidation,
biodegradation, and sinking/sedimentation (Huang 1983).  The composition
of the spilled oil and its temperature will determine the manner in which
the physical phenomena will act on the oil under the prevailing weather
and sea state.  The following characteristics of crude oil are of primary
interest:

  •  Specific density - determines rate of slick expansion

  •  Ratio of light vs. heavy molecular weight components - determines
     evaporation and weathering rates

  •  Pour point/waxiness/naphthenes contnet of weathered crude -
     determines stability of water-in-oil emulsions.

Figure 1 schematically shows the effects of natural weathering processes
on oil.

PHYSICAL PROCESSES

During a drilling operation blowout, oil can enter the marine environment
in two ways: at the surface, by rising through the apparatus, or more
likely at the borehole on the seafloor.  Once in contact with seawater,
the oil is subject to the physical weathering processes of spreading, drift,
evaporation, dissolution, emulsification, dispersion, and sedimentation.

Spreading

Oil begins spreading horizontally due to gravitational forces (Fay
1969).  This movement is first counterbalanced by inertial forces, and
then by viscous or frictional forces.  When the slick thins sufficiently,
surface tensions at the oil-air and oil-water interfaces become dominant
and overcome the viscous forces.  This continues until the slick ceases
to spread.  The spreading process is enhanced by warmer water temperatures
and increased wave action.  Crude oil has been observed to form two distinct
phases:  a thick oil phase [1-20 mm (0.04-0.8 in) thick], consisting of
highly viscous emulsified oil, and a thin oil or blue sheen phase [0.01-0.001
mm thick].  The thick oil appears on the surface as several small slicks
or strips, which continue to break down into smaller and smaller patches
of oil (Audunson et al. 1980).

Drift

Wind, waves, and surface currents control the drift, or advection
of an oil slick.  The ability to predict the drift behavior of an oil slick

Figure 1. Weathering and dispersion effects on oil in the marine environment.
depends on the availability of accurate wind and current data, and on a 
good empirical model. Several drift models exist, but they may only be 
realistically used to assess the risk of impacts to shorelines (Wheeler 
1978). The use of such models is generally limited to nearshore spills, 
and would probably be of little value for predicting the fate of an open 
ocean spill.

Evaporation

Oil released to the water surface is immediately subject to evaporation. 
Because evaporation can account for the loss of approximately 60 percent 
of spilled crude oil (Wheeler 1978), it is an extremely important process 
affecting the lifetime of the spill and the extent to which environmental 
resources might be impacted. The amount and rate of evaporation depend 
primarily on the percentage of volatile components in the oil. In general, 
the volatile components are more toxic to marine organisms than are the 
non-volatile components. Thus, weathering protects marine organisms against 
exposure to the potentially damaging, toxic components in crude oil.

Dissolution

Dissolution is the process whereby oil is dissolved into the water 
column by natural or chemically induced dispersion. Typically, the volatile 
crude oil components that are toxic to marine organisms (i.e., aromatics 
and low molecular weight alkanes) are also the most readily soluble. For-
tunatley for marine biota, the volatile components are likely to evaporate 
at a much greater rate when they are dissolved.

Emulsification

During emulsification, water droplets are dispersed into the oil medium, 
turning the oil into a thick mixture commonly referred to as "chocolate 
mousse." This mixture may contain up to 75 percent water. The emulsification 
process is controlled by wave mixing action and water temperature. Emulsi-
fication is important because emulsions spread much more slowly than do 
pure oil slicks and, as a result, are less susceptible to other forms of 
weathering.

Oil escapement at the seafloor results in a greater degree of initial 
emulsification than does a similar event on the water surface. The degree 
of emulsification depends primarily on water depth, oil type, and the amount 
of gaseous emissions. In general, the extent of emulsification increases 
with water depth and amount of gaseous emissions. Experimental evidence 
suggests, however, that a blowout occurring at depths greater than 800 m 
(2,625 ft) would be devoid of gas. Oil from such a well would rise slowly 
in large drops and appear at the surface as combination of a slick, an 
emulsion, and in suspension as small droplets (Wadhaus 1981).

Dispersion

Dispersion of oil particles into the water column is important because 
it largely determines the lifetime of a slick. Wave action is thought 
to be the primary factor controlling dispersion rates. It is likely that 
the dispersion rate is a function of the oil slick thickness, oil-water

B-4
interfacial tension, sea state, and, especially, the fraction of the sea 
that is covered by breaking waves (Huang 1983).  The dispersion mechanisms 
change with slick thickness (McKay et al. 1980).  A relationship was developed 
between the probabilities of breaking waves and oil droplets remaining 
dispersed in the water column (Aravamudan et al. 1982).  Breaking waves 
are thought to cause the oil layer to be propelled into the water column, 
thus forming a "shower" of oil droplets. Most of the oil particles rise 
again to the slick and coalesce there, but some of the smaller oil droplets 
diffuse downwards and become permanently incorporated into the water column. 
When oil is released from the sea bottom, dispersion is also a function 
of depth and current velocity.

Sinking/Sedimentation

As oil weathers, its specific gravity may exceed that of water, causing 
it to sink.  However, weathering is probably a factor of minor importance. 
A more important factor is probably adhesion to particulate matter, and 
subsequent sinking.  Type, size, and load of sediment; salinity; concentrations 
of sulphur and organic matter in the oil; and degree of agitation affect 
the adsorption-desorption process.  Zooplankton and other organisms may 
also contribute to sedimentation by ingesting and excreting oil droplets 
and bits of tar.

CHEMICAL/BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES

Long-term degradation of crude oil is accomplished by chemical and 
biochemical action.  The two major chemical/biochemical degradation processes 
are described below.

Auto-Oxidation

The term auto-oxidation includes chemical oxidation and photo-oxidation. 
Photo-oxidation is the more important of the two.  During both processes, 
hydrocarbons are oxidized through the formation of water-soluble intermediate 
or end products.  The rate of oxidation depends primarily on the intensity 
and amount of sunlight, degree of emulsification, and the type of oil. 
Oxidation may occur over weeks or months with only a minor reduction in 
oil volume.  Oxidation products (e.g., acids, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, 
or metal salts) are usually water-soluble and subject to dilution.

Biodegradation

Biodegradation proceeds slowly, but it is the main process by which 
spilled oil is removed from the marine environment.  Species of bacteria 
that biodegrade oil are ubiquitous, and use the crude oil as a metabolic 
energy source.  Since bacteria also need oxygen, biodegradation takes place 
mainly at the oil-water interface.  Because it is a slow process, biodegradation 
is often neglected when assessing the short-term (i.e., 15-30 days) fate 
of spilled oil.
