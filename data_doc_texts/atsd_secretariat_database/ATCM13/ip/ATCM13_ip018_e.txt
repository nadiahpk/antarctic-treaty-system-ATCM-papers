FOREWORD

This Report of United States Antarctic Activities contains the two parts of 
the Antarctic Treaty Exchange of Information: Part A - Modifications of 
Plans for 1984-85; and Part B - Plans for Activities for 1985-86.  These 
items are due on June 30, 1985 and November 30, 1985 respectively, have been 
combined into a single volume.  This early publication of the Plans for the 
1985-86 season is intended to facilitate international cooperation and 
coordination.

INTRODUCTION

Part A of this document is entitled Modifications of Plans for 1984-85. It 
includes changes to the information in Part A of our June 1984 report,
together with a complete list of personnel in the U.S. Antarctic Research
Program (USARP).  Part B, titled Plans for Activities for 1985-86, includes
the research projects and various elements of support that will be involved
in the coming austral summer and winter. The organization and content of
this report of United States Antarctic Activities is provided in response to
Articles III(1) and VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty.  The format is that
prescribed in the Annex to Treaty Recommendation VIII-6.

While the principal activity reported herein is the national Antarctic
Program (USAP) under management of the National Science Foundation (NSF),
other activities (e.g.: tourism) sponsored by private U.S. groups or indivi-
duals are included.  In the past, some private U.S. groups have arranged
their activities with groups in another Treaty nation; to the extent that
these become known to us, these activities are also included.

In order to increase the utility of this information exchange we have again
this year added a sub-section C to Section X of Part A (Modifications) that
summarizes visitor activity experienced at each U.S. station during the
austral summer season.  Treaty members may find this list useful in connec-
tion with Treaty Recommendation IV-27.

Research investigations in the USAP are carried out by scientists from
universities and colleges, government agencies and private companies who are
funded under a system of grants and contracts administered by NSF.  This
system includes an annual competition for support of research proposed by
U.S. scientists, and rigorous selection based on scientific merit as evalu-
ated through peer review. NSF includes in the USAP as many of the most
meritorious research proposals as can be accommodated by our operational and
logistic support resources.

NSF procures operational and logistic support of the USAP from a private
company under contract and from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy under
separate Memoranda of Agreement.  The Commander, U.S. Naval Support Force
Antarctica exercises local operational control on behalf of the NSF and
arranges for annual resupply support by the Navy's Military Sealift Command
and the Military Airlift Command of the U.S. Air Force.  Overall responsibi-
lity for the USAP is exercised by a Senior U.S. Representative in Antarctica
who is designated by NSF.

MODIFICATIONS OF PLANS FOR
1984-85
SECTION I

The names, types, numbers, descriptions, and armament of ships, aircraft,
and other vehicles introduced into the Antarctic Treaty area and information
on military equipment, if any, and its location in the area.

In October 1984, one of the USAF C-141 aircraft, being used for logistic
support, released a tracer gas between New Zealand and Antarctica as a part
of the study of circulation patterns over Antarctica.

A twin otter aircraft was chartered from Kenn Borek Ltd. of Canada to
provide support for research projects in the Siple Coast and Ross Ice Shelf
areas from 18 November 1984 to 18 January 1985.

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ANTARCTIC SNOW.  Stephen G. Warren and
Thomas C. Grenfall, University of Washington.

In Antarctica the radiation budget, long recognized as the driving
force of the continent's climate, may affect not only the southern
hemisphere climate but also worldwide climate.  Although scien-
tists have measured the amount of solar radiation transmitted back
into the atmosphere, these averaged measurements do not account
for changes in wavelength caused by the radiative properties of
the Sun, atmosphere, clouds, and snow.  The results of the two
most thorough antarctic studies, which concentrated on the visible
light spectrum, disagree dramatically and cannot easily be used in
climate or energy-budget models.  Also, studies have shown that
the presence of small amounts of pollution such as dust or
graphitic carbon can greatly alter measurements made in the near-
infrared range.  We have developed a theoretic model, which in
tests has provided accurate measurements in the near-infrared but
not in the visible light range, for measuring the spectral albedo.
Because no investigations have been conducted with pure snow (snow
with extremely small amounts of contamination), we will test our
model at sites near South Pole Station.  Using a spectrophotometer,
we establish the spectral variation of the surface albedo
as function of wavelength.  We will use radiation measurements and
analyses of light-absorbing impurities in the snow to determine
how far away from the station experiments can be conducted and
still accurately represent the polar plateau and to learn whether
earlier radiation-budget studies were influenced by their
proximity to stations.  Also we will study the effects of sastrugi
on the snow albedo.  Models that can be used to accurately
describe radiation and energy-budget balances in the polar regions
are critical for studying the effects of pollutants on global
climate.

ACOUSTIC RESEARCH ON WEDDELL SEALS (LEPTONYCHOTES WEDDELLI) THAT
RELATES TO MAN-MADE NOISE IN MCMURDO SOUND, ANTARCTICA.  Jeanette
Thomas and Barbara Bohne, Hubbs Sea World Research Institute.

For many years scientists have been concerned about the effects of
high amplitude underwater noise on marine organisms.  For example,
evidence of mortality and tissue damage in fish caused by under-

- 63 -
water dynamite explosions has been demonstrated by various marine
scientists. In McMurdo Sound, marine organisms are subjected to
several sources of high amplitude noise, including dynamite
explosions used by geologists to study ocean sediments and the
effects of breaking ice by Coast Guard icebreakers.  Considering
the degree of dependence on audible cues by marine mammals and the
long distance propagation of underwater sounds, any noise source
in their environment could cause significant disturbance to these
mammals. In 1982 biologists found two deaf Weddell seals in
McMurdo Sound and suggested that hearing damage has occured among
this population. To assess the possible impact of these manmade
noises on the region's Weddell seal population, we will collect
seal heads and transport them to McMurdo Station's laboratory to
remove the temporal bones and fixate the inner ears.  The results
of our study will provide information on the types and extent of
hearing damage within the seal population.  Although similar
studies have been conducted on terrestrial mammals, to our
knowledge this is the first attempt to use this method to examine
hearing damage in marine mammals. Our results will have worldwide
application to the question of whether manmade noise adversely
affects marine mammals.

PYGOSCELID PENGUIN POPULATION STUDIES.  Wayne Z. Trivelpiece and
Nicholas J. Volkman, Point Reyes Bird Observatory.

Penguins are major predators of krill (Euphausia superba) and an
important component of the antarctic marine food web.  To
thoroughly understand the structure and functions of the antarctic
ecosystem, biologists must have information on population dynamics
and the factors that regulate population sizes of penguins,
especially pygoscelid penguins, which are the dominant antarctic
genus.  The three pygoscelid penguins - Adelie (Pygoscelis
adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarctica), and gentoo (P. papua) - nest sympatrically at Point Thomas, King George Island, near the
Polish Arctowski Base. Here the gentoo population is stable while
the Adelie and chinstrap populations are increasing.  For several
years we have banded penguins at this site and studied their
breeding and feeding ecology. By determining the nest-site
tenacity, mate fidelity, survival, and reproductive success of
several hundred known-age pairs of each penguin species, we have
compiled data on mates, nest-site selection, and reproductive
success of these known-age penguins at Admiralty Bay.  These data
provide the basis for our 5-year investigation of population
dynamics of penguins in this region. This austral summer we will
band more penguin chicks, estimate the number and rate of bands
lost by banding both flippers on some birds, record arrival,
location, weight, breeding, and reproductive success of banded
penguins, and census colonies to determine population sizes of the
three species. Analysis of these data will enable us to determine
how demographic variables interact to affect changes in penguin
populations. If we have enough time, we will continue to band and
census other birds that nest near Point Thomas. We will focus on

- 64 -
birds that are predators or scavengers in penguin rookeries - 
brown and south polar skuas, American sheathbill, southern giant 
fulmar, and southern black-backed gull. Data from this project 
contribute to scientific understanding of the structure and 
function of the marine ecosystems and adds to present knowledge of 
population dynamics of marine organisms.

NUTRIENTS AND ICE SHELF WATER ALONG THE BARRIER EDGE OF THE ROSS 
ICE SHELF. Douglas C. Biggs, Texas A&M University.

New data have shown that the antarctic food "chain" is not a 
simple progression from large diatoms to macro-zooplankton (such 
as krill) to higher trophic levels but rather a dynamic microbial 
food web in which significant portions of primary production are 
recycled in the upper levels of the marine environment. Our 
research focuses on understanding the structure and dynamics of 
microbial organisms in the lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. 
Beginning in December 1984 we will make preliminary observations 
and measurements of the microbial communities in waters 
surrounding Anvers Island near the Antarctic Peninsula. Later in 
the austral summer (approximately mid-January) we hope to work 
with the West German antarctic program aboard their research ship 
Polarstern. By participating with the West German program we will 
be able to sample the upper portion of the water column between 
Anvers Island and the Weddell Sea. From these data we will 
determine the size distribution and abundance of pico- through 
micro-plankton and the relationship among the size, rate of 
growth, and metabolic activity of cells. Our research emphasizes 
understanding how much of the nanoplankton population during 
species successions is autotrophic or heterotrophic, what effects 
microbial grazing has on newly reduced organic carbon and the 
carbon's transfer to higher trophic levels, and what significance 
such microbial activity has for interpretating experimental data 
on the rates by which carbon and nitrogen are incorporated as 
compared to other parameters.

BIOENERGETICS OF THE ANTARCTIC FUR SEAL. Daniel P. Costa,
University of California, Santa Cruz.

The fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), a major consumer of krill in 
the southern ocean, has adapted its reproductive strategy to the 
antarctic environment. With more krill available, possibly 
because the baleen whale populatiobn has declined, the population 
of this seal has increased rapidly. These seals breed mainly on 
subantarctic islands during the brief periods of warm weather; the 
cycles of birth through weaning take about 4 to 5 months to 
complete. Because this rapid growth places heavy energy demands 
on the nursing females, successful reproduction depends on nearby 
availability of adequate supplies of food. By learning what the 
energy requirements are for successful pup rearing, we will

- 65 -
understand more of this seal's biology and will be better able to 
predict the potential effects of a major krill fishery on this 
species and the antarctic marine ecosystem.  With the assistance 
of the British Antarctic Survey, we will study antarctic fur seals 
at Bird Island, South Georgia.  We will measure the metabolism of 
unconfined individuals by using recently developed isotope 
methods.  Through these methods we hope to overcome the 
limitations posed by such conventional methods as measuring food 
intake and respiration of confined individuals.

ROSS SEA AEROMAGNETIC SURVEY.  John C. Behrendt, U.S. Geological 
Survey. 

In cooperation with scientists from the Federal Republic of 
Germany, we will conduct a geophysical and geological study in the 
Ross Sea-Victoria Land region of Antarctica.  Our principal 
objective is to determine the paleomagnetism of a large portion of 
the western Ross Sea basin.  West Germany pilots will fly an 
aeromagnetic survey in the southwest Ross Sea area at an elevation 
of 500 meters along east/west lines, spaced 4 kilometers apart. 
The survey area extends for about 400 kilometers and includes the 
area east from the west coast of the Ross Sea and north from the 
Ross Sea Ice Shelf to a position offshore where a West German 
survey will be conducted.  While in the field we will help 
coordinate the survey; after the field project is completed we 
will work cooperatively with West German geologists to analyze 
that data from the survey.

PROGRAM - GANOVEX IV.  Thomas Wright, National Science Foundation. 

I will work with New Zealand geologists from the University of 
Canterbury in a study of the structure and stratigraphy of the 
Handler Ridge and surrounding area in northern Victoria Land. 
From data gathered during this austral summer, we hope to 
determine the structural setting of upper Cambrian/Ordovician 
fossils found during the West German expedition to northern 
Victoria Land (GANOVEX III) in 1981-1982.  These data will further 
understanding of the structural relationship and geological 
history of northern Victoria Land and the tectonic relationship 
between New Zealand, Australia, and Antarctica.

MAGNETOSTRATIGRAPHY AND SEDIMENTOLOGY, DRY VALLEYS AND MCMURDO 
SOUND.  Donald P. Elston, U.S. Geological Survey. 

Our objective is to develop a viable magnetostratigraphy from core 
material drilled in the ice-free valleys of southern Victoria 
Land.  These data will be used for age determination, temporal 

- 66 -
control, and correlating with the geomagnetic time scale and will 
help determine sedimentation rates in McMurdo Sound.  This austral 
summer our field work will be limited to paleomagnetic and sedi-
mentologic sampling of cores drilled by New Zealand and U.S. 
(S-093) investigators during the 1984-85 austral summer in the 
ice-free valleys.

GAS ANALYSIS, ANALYSIS OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES AND GENERAL CORE 
PROCESSING AT SOUTH POLE.  Hans Oeschger, University of Bern.

In recent years the importance of ice cores for climatic research 
has grown because of the unique information they provide on the 
history of the Earth and planetary systems.  New analytical 
techniques have made possible measurements of carbon dioxide 
contents of the air in the past and of changes in cosmic-ray-
produced isotopes.  During the 1984-1985 austral summer we will 
concentrate on analyzing the ice core samples for concentrations 
of carbon dioxide.  We are particularly interested in the history 
and climatic influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  We will 
collect samples near South Pole Station and at sites on the Siple 
Coast.  Questions which our research will address are what were 
the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide before the 
industrial revolution and during the climatic optimum about 6,000 
years ago, what is the history of carbon dioxide increases from 
preindustrial times to 1958, what variations in concentrations 
occurred during the last few thousand years, and what is the age of 
the air in the firn at the transition of glacier ice.

PARTICIPATION IN THE U.S. ANTARCTIC PROGRAM - PALMER STATION. 
Yoshiyuki Ohyama, National Institute of Polar Research.

Working at the United State's Palmer Station, I will study various 
aspects of the terrestrial environment of the Antarctic Peninsula 
region.  I will collect samples of the wingless midge (Belgica 
antarctica) at different stages to obtain data on the insect's 
life cycles and samples of mites and springtails while recording 
information about their habitats.  For the herbarium at the 
National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo, I will sample 
mosses and lichens.  During my 3-month stay at the station, I will 
also attempt to attach a depth recorder to a penguin and later 
recover the recorder's data.

communications system at South Pole Station.  This system will be 
- 67 -
designed to transmit data from South Pole, using several polar
orbiting satellites, to McMurdo where the data will be entered to
the existing International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) system
for transmittal onward to the continental United States.  Voice
communications direct from South Pole to the ITT/Antarctic
Services, Inc. headquarters in Paramus, New Jersey will also be
provided.  This link will make use of the ATS-3 satellite which is
in a geosynchronous orbit at 105°W longitude.

B. DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES

Satellite communications with McMurdo Station were improved by moving
one of the two existing INMARSAT (International Maritime Satellite)
terminals to Cape Hodgson on Black Island (approximately 30 kilometers
south southwest of McMurdo Station). This move expanded the available
satellite window time to 21-22 hours/day. Voice and data are transmit-
ted to Black Island via a space diversity UHF radio system. The station
at Black Island is powered by a wind generator/vapor turbine system.
This system became operational on 24 January 1985.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established
data link facilities at South Pole Station and McMurdo Station via polar
orbiting NIMBUS and LANDSAT satellites. Geodetic positioning and
magnetic field data is relayed from South Pole to McMurdo via the data
link, and from McMurdo to the United States via INMARSAT.  This system
became operational on 16 December 1984.

NASA established a limited use voice link using a VHF transponder to the
ATS-3 satellite. Voice communications with the United States from
South Pole Station is possible for limited periods using this polar
orbiting satellite.  This system became operational on 16 December 1984.

SECTION II

Dates of Expeditions

A. Midwinter airdrops are planned using C-141 aircraft to parachute mail 
and supplies to McMurdo and South Pole Stations.  Annual augmentation of the 
U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) begins with austral winter flights (WINFly) 
departing the Naval Air Station, Point Mugu, California, about mid-August 1985 
via Christchurch, New Zealand, arriving at McMurdo Station, Antarctica about 
the last week in August 1985.  The flights carry scientists and support 
personnel to Antarctica to start early presummer projects, to augment 
maintenance personnel, and to prepare skiwavs and ice runways at McMurdo 
Station.  This will involve 6 LC-130 flights and increase station population 
from the winter-over level of 100 to a transition level of about 300.

B. Austral summer activities will be initiated in early October 1985 with 
wheeled aircraft operations between Christchurch, New Zealand and the sea-ice 
runway at McMurdo Stati?r, Antarctica.  This will involve approximately 18 
flights by C-141 transport aircraft of the U.S. Military Airlift Command, 
and 16 flights by C-130 aircraft of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.  The 
sea-ice runway and wheeled aircraft operations will cease about mid-December 
1985 and all subsequent aircraft operations will use the USAP LC-130 
aircraft and a prepared ski-way.

Other significant dates for the summer season include:

1.  First week in October 1985         - McMurdo Station full staffing
2.  Mid October 1985                    - Byrd Surface Camp re-opens

WINTER OXYGEN LEVELS IN AN ANTARCTIC LAKE.  George M. Simmons, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Robert A. Wharton, Jr. and
Christopher P. McKay, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Antarctic lakes perennially are enriched with high levels of oxygen.
Although in other environments these levels would be lethal to many
organisms, biota flourish under these conditions in antarctic lakes.
Biological activity and effects caused by large shifts in the freeze-thaw
cycle of the ice cover and associated inputs from glacial meltwater appear
to influence the oxygen budget in these lakes.  Scientific understanding of
the ecosystem and this cycle is incomplete because researchers have not been
able to measure oxygen levels during the austral winter.  For example,
presently we do not know whether the oxygen levels fluctuate during the year
or if these levels are steadily increasing.  Our objective is to use remote
sensing to acquire winter data and to construct a model for the oxygen cycle
from these and other data.  Working at Lake Hoare in Taylor Valley during
the austral summer, we will retrieve sediment traps and sample water at
various levels to establish a vertical profile for oxygen and chlorophyll a.
In the water column we will place temperature and oxygen electrodes, which
will be connected to an aquisition data bank on shore.  Because the instru-
ments will be underwater, they will be protected during the winter from
freezing and other adverse effects from the weather.  Remote sensing and
data transmission via satellites will enable us to acquire data continuously
over long periods of time.  When these data are combined with other data on
antarctic lake ecology, we will understand better how growth and production
in microbial communities are related to changes in the oxygen budget and how
shifts in the freeze-thaw cycle affect oxygen levels.  The development of
remote sensing techniques to study the ecology of an acquatic ecosystem also
will be useful to investigators working in other areas of the world.

BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY OF WEDDELL SEALS.  Donald B. Siniff, University of
Minnesota.

During the upcoming austral summer we will study Weddell seals while pups
are being born at a site near Hutton Cliffs, Ross Island.  Our focus is male
territorial and reproductive behavior and the activities of and interactions
between mothers and pups.  As males appear at the site, we will tag them
with small radio transmitters to record their activity in and out of the
water.  Before the pups are born, we will weigh the females; after birth
mothers and pups will be weighed weekly through the lactation period to
measure the amount of time that the mothers invest in caring for the pups.

- 123 -
To document attendance, nursing, and pup swimming experience, we will attach 
to a few mother and pup pairs small radio transmitters linked to lactation 
detectors.  We will continue to tag and census seals in the Ross Island 
area.  Early in the season we will locate and retag (when necessary) year-
old seals, tagged with radio transmitters at the end of the 1984-1985 
austral summer.  These observations will enable us to document the number of 
these immature seals and help to improve our estimates of survival rates for 
younger age classes.  During November and December 1985, we will use heli-
copters to search for tagged seals and groups of subadults on the east side 
of McMurdo Sound between Pram Point and Cape Evans.  Early in the austral 
summer we also will collect data on weather and ice conditions that may 
affect pupping distributions.

THE ROLE OF GLYCOPEPTIDE ANTIFREEZES IN FREEZING AVOIDANCE OF ANTARCTIC 
FISH.  Arthur L. DeVries, University of Illinois.

Living organisms adjust protein synthesis rates in response to environmental 
factors as a fundamental strategy for survival.  We have discovered that 
most antarctic fish living in ice-laden shallow water possess either glyco-
peptide or peptide compounds that have protein antifreeze properties.  
Results of our experiments have indicated that there are eight different-
sized glycopeptides, which lower the freezing point of body fluids below the 
temperature of the seawater (-1.9°C).  This season we will catch various 
species of native antarctic fish to continue our investigation of biological 
antifreeze systems.  Live fish, caught during the season, will be studied at 
the McMurdo Station aquarium to determine the distribution and role of these 
glycopeptides in various body fluids and tissues.  We also will study what 
part glycopeptides have in freezing avoidance, in intestinal fluid, what 
mechanisms cause them to move from blood to bile, and why they are not 
digested as they move through the intestinal track.  We will continue bio-
chemical studies of non-colligative lowering of the freezing point of water 
by examining the interaction between antifreezes and ice.  Additionally, we 
will examine the role of epithelial tissues in preventing ice propagation 
into undercooled fluids by determining at what sub-freezing temperatures 
these tissues act as a barrier, with or without the presence of glyco-
proteins.

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA).  William M. 
Hamner, University of California, Los Angeles.

Although krill dominates the antarctic marine ecosystem, few detailed 
observations of the crustacean at sea exist.  Results of earlier investi-
gations altered our assumptions about the open-ocean behavior of krill.  We 
found that krill form dense schools that move rapidly and migrate horizon-
tally to exploit high food concentrations by area-intensive searching and 
rapid feeding behavior.  Because chemicals rather than particles appear to 
trigger feeding, we have extended our investigation of how chemical cues 
initiate feeding and are comparing our findings on feeding morphology to 
other zooplankton.  To document swarming behavior and interactions, we will 
use 35-mm photographs and video films.  Also we will study the relationships

- 124 -
among krill behavior and feeding strategies of marine mammals and sea birds.
Sea birds that eat krill will be tracked to their feeding grounds, and some
will be collected for analysis.  Laboratory studies of behavioral responses
and structural morphology will be conducted at Palmer Station.  With color
video films, we will examine the relationship of swarming to feeding.  For
this study, phytoplankton will be marked with a dye, which will enable us to
establish relationships of krill swarm density and size with phytoplankton
concentration and patch size.  A 16-mm movie film will help us describe the
movement of particles and water as confined krill feed.

REPRODUCTION, FEEDING, AND SWIMMING ENERGETICS, AND EGG AND LARVAL
PHYSIOLOGY OF EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA.  Langdon Quetin and Robin Ross, University
of California.

Euphausia superba (krill) and related euphausid species are the most
abundant group of animals in the southern ocean.  Besides being exploited
heavily by almost all antarctic marine carnivores, krill is the focus of a
small, but growing, fishery.  Working in areas where krill is highly
concentrated, we will measure environmental parameters and seasonal
variation in school composition, fecundity, chemical composition, field
ingestion and egestion, and the sinking properties of fecal pellets of
krill.  At Palmer Station we will continue culturing the krill larvae to
study their development, behavior, feeding preferences, and metabolism.  We
also will study the swimming energetics and ingestion/egestion rates of
adult krill.  A technician, working at Palmer Station during the austral
winter, will conduct experiments on winter survival of krill--including
changes in metabolism, chemical composition, enzyme activity, and growth of
adults, as well as growth rates and development of feeding larvae.  The
results of this project should contribute substantially to understanding
aspects of krill biology that are either unknown or poorly understood.

ENDOLITHIC MICROORGANISMS IN ICE-FREE VALLEYS:  BIOLOGY AND
ORGANISM-SUBSTRATE INTERACTIONS.  E. Imre Friedmann, Florida State
University.

The climate of Antarctica is arid, especially in ice-free regions; katabatic
winds descending from the polar plateau heighten desert conditions.
Environmental extremes in such regions limit life to a narrow zone under the
surface of certain rocks.  Microorganisms inhabit either fissures and cracks
or the structural cavities of porous rocks.  In 1976 endolithic micro-
organisms in southern Victoria Land's ice-free valleys were first reported.
Reports of microbial colonies inhabiting different rocks in southern
Victoria Land and the Dufek Massif followed.  Since 1979 geological,
meteorological, and biological investigations have helped us to understand
the nature of highly adapted communities in southern Victoria Land.  In the
upcoming austral summer we will continue sampling communities at Linnaeus
Terrace in the Asgaard Range and other sites in the ice-free valleys of
southern Victoria Land.  Our research includes micrometeorological measure-
ments, estimation of respiration and net photosynthetic rates for microbial
communities, calculation of total yearly productivity, taxonomy of crypto-

- 125 -
endolithic lichens and algae, and the study of nonphotosynthetic bacteria.
We also will investigate the interactions between the organisms and the
rocks they inhabit (including chemistry, leaching, and biological
weathering), how the rocks are colonized, and the yearly accretion of nitro-
gen in rocks.  This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding
of cryptoendolithic microbial ecosystems, including their implications for
earth sciences.

CONTRASTING MODES OF REPRODUCTION IN ANTARCTIC MARINE INVERTEBRATES.  John
S. Pearse, University of California, Santa Cruz.

Many antarctic marine animals are brooders that provide post-spawning
parental care.  However, some of the most abundant shallow-water benthic
invertebrates spawn by broadcasting their gametes freely into the sea; the
larvae develop and feed independent of their parents.  To examine repro-
ductive biology, larval ecology, and demographics of several common species
of "broadcasters," we are sampling communities of the more common benthic
invertebrates in shallow waters of McMurdo Sound and identifying features
that contribute to their numerical success.  In the laboratory we raise
larvae through metamorphosis to learn about their morphology and behavior.
During the austral summer we will continue to sample larvae and juveniles to
find out how they are distributed and to document demographic features that
determine how frequently recruitment is needed to sustain the population.
Other laboratory and field work will identify what organisms prey on larvae
and juveniles of these species. We will contrast these data with data on
modes of trophic specialization and reproduction for less abundant species.
The results of this investigation should provide a better understanding of
not only how relatively few "broadcasters" maintain high densities in the
shallow antarctic benthos but also what factors make brooders more prevalent
in high-latitude marine ecosystems. Our research and techniques also should
be relevant to studies of other oceanic communities, especially deep-sea
ecosystems.

PREDATORY FEEDING ECOLOGY OF EUCHAETA ANTARCTICA, A MARINE PLANKTONIC
COPEPOD, AND CARNIVORY BY EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA, ANTARCTIC KRILL.  Jeannette
Yen, University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Most investigations of trophic interactions in plankton communities focus on
nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and ingestion by particle-grazing copepods
because most oceanic food webs are based on phytoplankton and in most
epipelagic ecosystems particle-grazing copepods dominate the zooplankton
community. Currently, biologists are looking at the next trophic level-
predatory zooplankton. Not only are these creatures an important link
between herbivorous zooplankton and planktivorous fish but they also are
involved in predator-prey interactions that are important to the structure
planktonic communities. Our objective is to study the predatory feeding
ecology of Euchaeta antarctica (planktonic copepod) and in laboratory
feeding experiments to document diet selectivity and functional responses to
preferred prey. To verify laboratory results, in the field we will
determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the predator and its

- 126 -
feeding index overlap with the distribution of its preferred prey.
Antarctic data will be compared with data on organisms from the same genus
that live in the Northern Hemisphere.  From this comparison we hope to
discover if different foraging strategies evolved for congeneric species as
a response to latitudinal differences in the plankton communities on which
these species feed.  We will apply the experimental procedures established
to describe carnivory by Euchaeta species to measure predation by krill.
Our long-term objectives are to ascertain patterns in trophic interactions
of invertebrate predators, understand the mechanism and evolution of the
predatory feeding response, and evaluate the role of predatory zooplankton
in maintaining community structure in marine systems.

PELAGIC BIRD DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO PREY AVAILABILITY AND PREY USE IN
THE SCOTIA SEA.  George L. Hunt, Jr., University of California, Irvine.

Smal1-scale ocean phenomena may concentrate prey and play a significant role
in the distribution of sea birds.  Using physical and biological oceano-
graphic data obtained concurrently with bird observations, we will investi-
gate the relationship between small-scale (1- to 10-kilometer) distribution
of birds at sea and the distribution of their prey, primarily krill.  This
austral summer we will census birds from aboard ship to continue documenting
distribution.  By combining these data with data obtained during the 1984-
1985 austral summer, we will be able to compare foraging distributions at
sea with the length of foraging trips and chick growth and survival for
different species.  Overall knowledge of how birds use krill swarms and of
areas in which birds forage will contribute to future management and conser-
vation programs.

PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL MICROPROCESSOR MONITORING STUDIES OF FREE-
RANGING ANTARCTIC SEALS IN PACK ICE.  Warren M. Zapol, Roger Hill, and Rober
Schneider, Massachusetts General Hospital.

Crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), and Ross
(Ommatophoca rossi) seals inhabit the pack ice between 55°S and just north
of Antarctica.  The Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) occupies fast ice
areas near the continent most of the year, but young Weddell seals move to
the pack ice during certain seasons.  Although the physiology and ecology of
Weddell seals living near antarctic stations have been documented to some
extend, little is known about the behavior of the younger Weddell seals or
the other three species living in the pack ice.  Because we have successful1y
developed a computer to monitor free-diving Weddell seals, we have developed
a cigar-box sized computer that can be attached to a seal's dorsal fin to
monitor via satellite the ecology and physiology of seals in the pack ice.
Working in the pack ice near the Antarctic Peninsula, we will attach monitor
packs to 30 crabeater, leopard and Weddell seals (10 per species).  By using
the monitors we will be able to examine and compare diving adptations.  The
monitors will record swimming velocity, heart rate, and seawater depth and
transmit this data to the Argos satellite system, which will also provide
data on where the seals are located.  A data retrieval system will be set up

- 127 -
at Palmer Station early in the summer and will operate year-round.
Additionally, we will perform autopsy biochemical studies on a few seals to
obtain data for comparison with physiologic and ecologic measurements.

MICROBIAL AND VERTEBRATE CHITIN DEGRADATION IN THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT.
James T. Staley, University of Washington.

Chitin is a primary component of the exoskeletons of marine invertebrates.
In the southern oceans high levels of primary productivity produce corres-
pondingly high concentrations of herbivorous consumers, particularly krill
whose dry weight is about 8 percent chitin. Over time the antarctic marine
environment would lose an enormous quantity of nitrogen and carbon if chitin
were not degraded and remineralized. Although few animals and mircoorganism
possess enzymes that solubilize chitin, our laboratory investigations
indicate that fin whales and Adelie penguins produce a pancreatic chitinase,
an externally secreted digestive enzyme produced by certain microogranisms
and invertebrates that degrades chitin. To determine the importance of
chitin in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of antarctic coastal waters, we will assess the extent to which these animals and others that feed on krill
actually degrade chitin. Working near Palmer Station, we will conduct
oceanographic studies from zodiacs and the Polar Duke and collect tissue
samples and gastrointestinal contents from a limited number of Adelie
penguins, crabeater seals, and chinstrap penguins. At the Palmer Station
laboratory, we will study the microbiology and enzymology of these samples.
Some chinstrap and Adelie penguins will be captured for feeding studies.
Also, we will investigate the distribution and activity of chitinolytic
microorganisms in the water column and sediments. The chitinases from all
of these sources will be isolated, purified, and characterized.

ASSEMBLY AND STABILITY OF MICROTUBULES FROM ANTARCTIC FISH AT LOW
TEMPERATURES.  H. William Detrich, III, University of Mississippi Medical
Center, School of Medicine.

Macromolecular assemblies of proteins perform many essential cellular
processes. Cytoplasmic microtubules are tube-like, subcellular filaments
composed of the major protein subunit, tubulin, and one or more microtubule-
associated proteins (MAPs). The ordered assembly, maintenance, and disas-
sembly of cytoplasmic microtubules play critical roles in cell division,
nerve growth and regeneration, cell-shape determination, and cytoplasmic
transport. At temperatures near 0oC the cold-labile microtubules of warm-
blooded vertebrates can be broken down rapidly into their simpler subunits.
In contrast, the cold-stable microtubules of antarctic marine poikilotherms
must be assembled and maintained at extremely low temperatures (approxi-
mately -2o to +2oC). Our project focuses on the biochemical adaptations
that facilitate the assembly, stability, and function at low temperatures of
microtubule proteins isolated from cold-adapted antarctic fish.  The results
of our 1984-1985 austral summer experiments suggest that cold stability in
microtubules is caused by alterations in the structure of the tubulin
subunit. This austral summer we will compare the chemical structures of
cold-stable and cold-labile tubulins. We will collect fish (Notothenia

- 128 -
coriiceps, N. gibberifrons, and Chaenocephalus aceratus) near Palmer Station, Brabant Island, and Low Island in the southern Bransfield Strait. 
To probe the differences in structure of cold-stable tubulins from antarctic 
fish brains and cold-labile tubulins from cow and catfish brains, we will 
use peptide mapping, high-resolution isoelectric focusing, and two-
dimensional electrophoretic analysis. With these data we will determine if 
tubule-associated proteins or other ligands have a role in the cold 
stability of microtubules. We also will continue our thermodynmic studies 
of the forces that stabilize microtubules at low temperatures. Our research 
will contribute to an understanding of the mechanism and thermodynamics of 
the assembly and structural stability of microtubules at low temperatures.

GROWTH, PHOTOSYNTHESIS, AND CARBON METABOLISM OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE 
SOUTHERN OCEAN: A SPECIES APPROACH. Richard B. Rivkin and Ian Morris, Horn 
Point Environmental Laboratory, University of Maryland.

In a changing environment, phytoplankton typically adapt by altering a 
particular metabolic pathway or pattern of nutrient use. Over a short time 
these adaptive mechanisms enable the cell to operate efficiently.  In the 
southern oceans phytoplankton are exposed to discontinuous light and 
nutrients because of turbulent motion, seasonal variations in light, varying 
cloud cover and wave action, and localized and periodic regeneration of 
nutrients. Biologists in 1980 reported that southern ocean phytoplankton 
can incorporate 70 to 80 percent of recent products of phyotosynthesis into 
lipids and smaller amounts into proteins. This finding contrasts with the 
traditional interpretations of primary production measurements. Studies in 
the Arctic, Antarctic, and laboratories suggest that the pattern of carbon 
uptake varies significantly with species and geographic location. Our 
objective is to evaluate the relationship between the biochemistry and 
growth of individual phytoplankton species. Near McMurdo Station we will 
collect water samples, ice algae, and phytoplankton from beneath the ice and 
in open water. With these samples we can measure the photosynthesis-light 
relationship, cell-division rates, and partitioning of recent products of 
photosynthesis into low molecular compounds, lipids, polysaccharides, and 
proteins. We also will estimate how much the dominant phytoplankton species 
contribute to total- and net-plankton primary production and measure how 
long adaptation to new light and temperature regimes takes. Biochemical 
analysis will be conducted at McMurdo's Eklund Biological Center.  By 
examining specific species in nature and laboratory cultures, we will 
determine the relationship between cellular biochemistry and the division 
rate of individual algal species and evaluate the coupling between carbon 
metabolism and phytoplankton growth in an environment subject to extreme 
changes in light and temperature.

PHYSIOLOGY OF SEA ICE ALGAE: CHANGES IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC METABOLISM DURING
THE COURSE OF A SPRING BLOOM.  Anna C. Palmisano and Cornelius W. Sullivan,
University of Southern California.

Microalgae are trapped in the bottom of the annual sea ice in McMurdo Sound
during the entire spring bloom.  Biologists have reported that standing
crops can represent chlorophyll a levels as high as 300 milligrams of
chlorophyll a per square meter.  Sea ice microalgae also may serve as a model
for studying physiological changes during an algal bloom.  Because vertical
mixing and horizontal advection are absent and losses from grazing and
sinking are reduced, we are able to follow a single community through bloom
development and decay.  Our objective is to examine physiological changes in
ice algae from the beginning of the bloom in October through its decay in
January in both bottom congelation and platelet ice communities and to
determine the primary factors affecting eventual senescence.  We will focus
on changes in photosynthetic metabolism occurred at the start, peak, and
decline of the ice algal bloom and use growth rates to estimate changes in
biomass over intervals of several days.  The factors that may contribute to
biological changes in ice algal communities before ice ablation include
osmotic stress, nutrient limitation, self-shading, and oxygen inhibition.
We will test the effects of these variables on both natural populations and
laboratory cultures.

PYGOSCELID PENGUIN POPULATION STUDIES IN ADMIRALTY BAY.  Wayne Trivelpiece,
Point Reyes Bird Observatory.

Penguins are major predators of krill (Euphausia superba) and an important
component of the antarctic marine food web.  To thoroughly understand the
structure and function of the antarctic ecosystem, biologists must have
information on population dynamics and the factors that regulate population
sizes of penguins, especially pygoscelid penguins, which are the dominant
antarctic genus.  The three pygoscelid penguins--Adelie (Pygoscelis
adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarctica), and gentoo (P. papua)--nest
sympatrically at Point Thomas, King George Island, near the Polish Arctowski
Base.  Here the gentoo population is stable while the Adelie and chinstrap
populations are increasing.  For several years we have banded penguins at
this site and studied their breeding and feeding ecology.  By determining
the nest-site tenacity, mate fidelity, survival, and reproductive success of
several hundred known-age pairs of each penguin species, we have compiled
data on mates, nest-site selection, and reproductive success of these
known-age penguins at Admiralty Bay.  Between 1 October 1985 and 15 February
1986, we will make daily observations of banded, known-age Adelie,
chinstrap, and gentoo penguins in two rookeries on King George Island.
These observations will enable us to determine how sex, age, and experience
are related to fecundity and survival.  Data from this project contribute to
scientific understanding of the structure and function of the marine
ecosystems and adds to present knowledge of population dynamics of marine
organisms.

THE TROPHIC POSITIONS OF BENTHIC RHIZOPODA IN ANTARCTIC COMMUNITIES.  Ted E.
DeLaca, Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Although benthic foraminifera are abundant in many marine communities, their
trophic positions and significance in energy transfer and community dynamics
remains unknown. Much of the published information on benthic foraminifera
is limited to zoogeographic and systematic studies of about 60 of the 4,000
cataloged species. Our research focuses on one type of benthic foramini-
fera, rhizopods, which appear to be important in the energy transfer in
benthic food webs. Capable of rapid growth on various food, they may
represent large standing stocks, prey on microbial life forms, and serve as
a food source to higher trophic levels, especially small species and devel-
opmental stages of larger ones. The McMurdo Sound region has diverse types
of habitats with distinctive foraminiferal assemblages, ranging from
shallow-water to deep-ocean species. Because the polar environment has
pronounced seasonal fluctuations in benthic populations, we can sort out
ecological relationships more easily. During this austral summer we will
analyze the energy flow into rhizopod populations, evaluate the standing
stocks, biomasses, and chemical and caloric compositions, and determine what
species are most likely to prey on benthic rhizopods.  During the austral
summer, we work mostly at New Harbor, Ross Island, where we will dive under
the ice to collect samples. Observations will also be made on the eastern
and western sides of McMurdo Sound. Because our investigation is year-
round, we will obtain information not only on the roles of rhizopods in
antarctic benthic communities but also on environmental changes and the
resulting population dynamics.

ULTRA LONG-PERIOD SEISMIC AND GRAVITY OBSERVATIONS.  Leon Knopoff and W.D.
Smythe, University of California, Los Angeles.

Because Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is a seismically quiet platform,
which lies on the Earth's rotational axis, we use this site to measure long-
period oscillations of the Earth with two ultralong-period seismometers
(modified La Coste-Romberg gravity meters).  The location of this station on
Great Circle Paths, which coincides with portions of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
and the East Pacific Rise, is advantageous for studying phase velocities
sensitive to the middle-mantle structure under an oceanic ridge.  We also
hope to observe motions of the Earth's inner core.  The station's location,
its symmetric position between the oceans, and the low noise at the site
favor observations of long-period tides and free oscillations.  Our goal is
to attain a better understanding of the deep structure and lateral inhomo-
geneities of the Earth.

specific orbits, and data from both stations will help determine the spatial

as well as electronic and conventional surveying methods.  This new

TRIASSIC VERTEBRATES FROM THE BEARDMORE GLACIER AREA OF ANTARCTICA.  William 
R. Hammer, Augustana College.

In 1967 Ohio State University geologists discovered a lower jaw fragment of 
a fossil labyrinthodont (a type of amphibian) at Graphite Peak (85°3'S 
172°19'E).  The fossil was embedded in a pebbly, quartzose sandstone of 
fluvial origin in the lower part of what is now identified as the Fremouw 
Formation.  This formation is an extensive sedimentary sequence between 140 
and 400 million years old that makes up much of the Transantarctic 
Mountains.  Since that time, geologists have recovered numerous fossils 
remains of amphibians and reptiles of Triassic age (208 to 245 million years 
old) from the Fremouw Formation in the central Transantarctic Mountains.  
These discoveries not only demonstrate the potential that more vertebrate 
fossils are embedded in the Fremouw Formation but also provide data that 
enable us to reconstruct the community structure and environmental setting 
of land vertebrates in Antarctica more than 200 million years ago.  Data 
from previous investigations indicate that two communities existed--an 
amphibian group that dominated the channels of what was once a river and a 
reptilian group that dominated the flood plains.  Our objective this austral 
summer is to collect fossils near the Beardmore Glacier from as many strati-
graphic levels and facies types within the Fremouw Formation as possible.  
With these fossils we will be better able to describe community composition, 
structure, succession, and evolution.  By collecting more vertebrate 
fossils, we will expand the taxonomic list and establish stratigraphic 
relationships of antarctic assemblages with assemblages from other areas of 
the world.  From these data we will gain a better understanding of the evo-
lutionary history of many vertebrates that existed worldwide from the 
Permian to Triassic periods.  When the vertebrate paleontologic data is 
integrated with sedimentologic and paleobotanic data, we will be able to 
begin working on a model of the paleo-environmental setting of Antarctica 
during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic.

SEDIMENTOLOGY OF THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC GONDWANA SEQUENCE IN THE CENTRAL 
TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS.  James W. Collinson, Ohio State University.

Our objective is to learn more about the nature and history of the basins 
next to the Pacific margin of Gondwana.  To accomplish this, we will study 
the 2.5-kilometer-thick sequence of Upper Carboniferous to Triassic glacial, 
possible marine, and terrestrial sedimentary rocks near the Beardmore 
Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Working with geologists from 
Vanderbilt University, Ohio State University, and University of Illinios 
(S-062), we will sample rocks at Graphite Peak, Mt. Kinsey, Mt. Wild, 
Mt. Miller, Clarkson Peak, Mt. Roper, Painted Cliffs, Cranfield Peaks, 
Mt. Weeks, Lowery Glacier, Disch Promontory, Mt. Acher[n?]ar, Mt. Mills, 
Fremouw Peak, Mt. Falla, Mt. Sirius, Coalsack Bluff, Wahl Glacier, 
Mt. Picciotto, and the Moore Mountains.  While the geologists from project 
S-062 will focus on the lower part of the stratigraphic squence (tillite and 
black shale), we will concentrate on the upper terrestrial sequence.  From 
these samples we hope to achieve a better understanding of the Late Carbon-
iferous to Early Permian glacial history and paleogeography in the evolution 
of the continents that made up Gondwana and to improve facies models for

- 133 -
glacial environments. We will determine the nature and origin of the post-
glacial black shale squence of Early Permian age that occurs throughout the
Transantarctic Mountains. We will assist paleontologists from Wayne State
College and Augustana College in reconstructing the depositional histories
and environmental settings of Permian coal-bearing delta/coastal plain
depositions and Triassic fluvial deposits. Also, we will work out the
post-depositional history of this basin including how Jurassic intrusive
rocks (diabase) altered the sediments.

LATE CENOZOIC GLACIAL HISTORY. George H. Denton, University of Maine.

The Beardmore Glacier flows from the polar plateau through the central
Transantarctic Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf. Because this glacier lies
near the center of the continent and contains extensive ice-free terrain
with well-perserved glacial deposits, data from the region near the glacier
are important for testing models of the massive late Tertiary ice sheets
that overrode the Transantarctic Mountains. Our objective is to examine the
chronology and character of the Neogene ice-sheet overriding of the Trans-
antarctic Mountains and to test our model for changes in the antarctic ice
sheet over the last several million years. Working with investigators from
the University of Wisconsin (S-061), we will map and study soil development
on lateral moraines in ice-free areas along the Beardmore Glacier. Where
possible, we will sample and date by carbon-14 methods algae from lakes that
formerly were dammed beside a thicker Beardmore Glacier. We also will
analyze soluable salts from numerous soil profiles in the moraines to
describe and date soil-forming processes.

METEORITICS. William A. Cassidy, University of Pittsburgh.

Meteorites are useful in investigating possible changes through time in the
meteoroid flux at Earth, measuring the cosmic-ray flux in past eras,

defining the abundances and characteristics of pre-solar-system organic
molecules. This austral summer two field parties will systematically search
areas near the Beardmore Glacier and in the Thiel Mountains. The group
working near the Beardmore Glacier will use motor toboggans to traverse
north along the polar plateau side of the Transantarctic Mountains, possibly
as far north as the Geologists Range. The second group will do reconnais-
sance in the Thiel Mountains to find new meteorite sites; they also will
collect meteorites at sites that were identified in earlier investigations.

PETROLOGY OF FERRAR AND UPPERMOST BEACON ROCKS, BEARDMORE GLACIER REGION.
David H. Elliot, Ohio State University.

Near the Beardmore Glacier is one of the best and possibly most complete 
Gondwana sequences in Antarctica. This sequence, the Victoria Group of the 
Beacon Supergroup, was deposited in a foreland basin near an active volcanic 
arc. Data on these deposit indicate that these deposits were close to 
volcanic vents.  In the sandstone, volcanic material is abundant as a 
detrial component, particularly in the uppermost parts of the sequence where 
pyroclastic rocks, which are composed of volcanic materials ejected from 
volcanos during explosive events, become increasingly more important.  This 
explosive vulcanism was abruptly replaced by the extrusion of tholeiitic 
flood basalts (Kirkpatrick Basalt) of the Ferrar Group.  This group consti-
tutes a unique geochemical province that is characterized by high initial 
strontium isotope ratios.  The formation of the Ferrar Group from magma is 
related to the early stages of the break-up of Gondwana.  This austral 
summer we will focus on the stratigraphy, petrology, geochemistry of 
Jurassic Ferrar tholeiites and volcanic rocks of the upper Falla and Prebble 
formations of the Beacon Supergroup. Our objectives are to establish the 
characteristics of the magmatism responsible for the volcanic rocks in the 
uppermost Beacon Supergroup, to investigate the petrogenesis of the Ferrar 
basalts and dolerites (particularly iron-enrichment found in "high-titanium" 
basalts), to establish the regional contact relationships between the lavas 
and underlying Beacon rocks, and to investigate homogeneity of lava flows. 
We also will collect fossil flora and fauna from sedimentary interbeds in 
the basalt sequence.  Our investigation will contribute to understanding the 
magmatism associated with Beacon rocks, the volcanism and tectonics related 
to the break-up of Gondwana, and the petrogenesis of basaltic magmas.

LATE CENOZOIC GLACIAL HISTORY AND SOIL DEVELOPMENT.  James G. Bockheim,
University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The history of antarctic ice dynamics relates to the causes of global ice 
ages and provides insights into the behavior of past northern hemisphere ice 
sheets.  During the Quaternary, eustatic sea level and precipitation 
controlled ice-sheet fluctuations, as grounded ice repeatedly covered 
peripheral continental shelves. By combining geologic and soil studies we 
have developed a model for late Cenozoic ice-sheet fluctuations and soil 
development.  The model has enabled us to infer multiple, earlier glacia-
tions with ice-volume maximums greater than those during the Quaternary. 
Salinization from marine aerosols is predominant in soil formed during this 
time.  To extend our antarctic data base, we will work with investigators 
from the University of Maine (S-056) at sites along the Beardmore Glacier. 
Also, we will complete our work in the ice-free valleys of southern Victoria

- 135 -
Land.  In Taylor and Wright valleys and nearby mountain areas, we will use 
soils in relative-age dating of glacial deposits and study the nature, 
distribution, and origin of salts in the soil.  Data from southern Victoria 
Land and the Beardmore Glacier area will not only help to test our model but 
also contribute to an understanding of antarctic soil formation over the 
last several million years.

TECTONIC DEVELOPMENT OF WEST ANTARCTICA AND ITS RELATION TO EAST ANTARCTICA. 
Ian W.D. Dalziel, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.

Over several years we have compiled data and conducted field research to 
gain an understanding of the relationship between East and West Antarctica 
through geologic time. Although our previous investigations have focused on 
the Scotia Arc, more data on the region at the base of the Antarctic 
Peninsula extending to the Ellsworth, Thiel, and Whitmore Mountains is 
necessary.  During the 1983-1984 austral summer, U. S. and British 
geologists began an intensive investigation in Ellsworth Mountains, Martin 
Hills, and Mt. Smart and near Siple Station. Field work includes geology, 
paleomagnetism, geochronology, and geophysics with radio-echo sounding and 
aeromagnetic surveys conducted by British geophysicists.  During the 1985-
1986 austral summer, we will work with British Antarctic Survey personnel

- 136 -
who will conduct an airborne geophysical investigation in the Ellsworth 
Mountains.  This investigation will attempt to define the limits of the 
blocks and determine the tectonic nature of the ice-covered area between 
them.

SEISMICITY OF MT. EREBUS AND VICINITY.   Juergen Kienle, University of 
Alaska.

Mount Erebus, an intraplate volcano on Ross Island, contains the world's 
only persistent convecting lava lake that is accessible for study.  By using 
seismic and acoustic data we will try to define the geomerty and eruptive 
behavior of the magma body that feeds the Erebus lava lake.  We also will 
study the general seismicity of the Ross Island region.  From this infor-
mation we may begin to understand why there is active intraplate volcanism 
in the McMurdo Sound area.  Since the 1980-1981 austral summer, a U.S.-
Japan-New Zealand project has used a radio-telemetered seismograph network 
on Ross Island to acquire this data.  This season we will service the 
network's 10 permanent seismic stations.  The seismic network helps to 
precisely locate microearthquakes in order to define active areas of the 
Ross Islands volcanos and to monitor long-term seismic and acoustic energy 
release and fluctuations.

STUDIES OF ANATOMICALLY PRESERVED PLANTS FROM THE PERMIAN AND TRIASSIC 
PERIODS OF ANTARCTICA.  Thomas N. Taylor, Ohio State University.

Our collection of fossil plants will be divided into two phases.  During the 
first phase we will collect silica permineralizations from sites at 
Mt. Augusta and Fremouw Peak.  The plants from these areas are structurally 
perserved, and the variety of plants is more diverse at these two sites than 
any other Permian and Triassic sites in the world.  While collecting plants, 
we also will study their general distribution and the associated deposi-
tional features.  For the second phase of our project, we will collect 
compression/impression specimens of fossil plants at other sites in the 
Beardmore Glacier region including Graphite Peak, Mt. Wild, Mt. Miller, 
Mt. Mills, Mt. Archernar, Coalsack Bluff, Mt. Sirius, and Mt. Ropar.  We 
also will explore the region for additional fossil-plant-bearing sites.  
During this part of our investigation we will characterize various floras, 
specifically those with biostratigraphy relative to other known floras of 
Gondwana age.

ICE-PROXIMAL GLACIMARINE SEDIMENTATION IN MCMURDO SOUND.  Ross D. Powell, 
Northern Illinois University.

In temperate and tropical regions, marine, nearshore marine, and estuarine 
processes influence sediment; however, in polar regions the presence of ice 
modifies these processes and introduces new processes.  Little information 
has been collected on how glaciers influence nearby marine environments and 
affect sedimentation processes or how presence of a glacier is reflected in

- 137 -
sed iments. We will conduct detailed sediment and oceanic sampling at the 
front of the Ferrar Glacier, a valley glacier flowing eastward from the 
Transantarctic Mountains into McMurdo Sound. When this glacier reaches sea 
water, it deforms plastically into a floating glacier tongue.  Bottom 
sed iments will be taken by grab sampling and sea-ice coring in front of the 
glacier; these samples, analyzed for internal structure, texture, and com-
position, will be used to describe sedimentary facies.  Salinity, tempera-
ture, water-current velocities, and sediment concentrations in the water 
column will also be measured. Our objective is to describe sediment 
depositional processes and sediment characteristics of glacimarine sediment 
in a modern polar regime. From these data we will develop a lithofacies 
model that can be integrated with other models of regimes in the glacimarine 
environment and used to interpret facies assemblages and sequences in 
outcrops and cores.  Such data are vital for reliable interpretations of 
paleoglacial, paleoclimatic, and paleotectonic conditions from McMurdo Sound 
and Ross Sea cores.

VOLCANIC GEOLOGY OF MARIE BYRD LAND -- WEST ANTARCTICA.  Wesley E. 
LeMasurier, University of Colorado, Denver.

In January 1983 during an investigation of the Ross Sea coast between Cape 
Adare and Beaufort Island, we found that volcanic sequences there differed 
from those in Marie Byrd Land. We identified only a few rocks as hyalo-
clastites (volcanic deposits composed predominately of fragmented volcanic 
glass produced when lava interacts with water during an eruption) but found 
many lithic breccia altered by hydrothermal activity to look like hyalo-
clastites. Our analysis of samples collected during this study suggests 
that in the Ross Sea area volcanos did not erupt beneath a thicker ice sheet 
as they apparently did in Marie Byrd Land.  This austral summer we will 
return to this area and visit sites at Beaufort Island, Cape Hallett, Cape 
Royds, and Cape Crozier. Because our observations and analysis differ 
significantly from previously published material, we will conduct detailed 
studies to obtain a better understanding of the glacial and volcanic history 
recorded in rocks in this region. The analysis of these samples will be 
compared with previous analysis of volcanic rocks from Marie Byrd Land to 
enable us to better understand the past behavior of the west antarctic ice 
sheet.

CONTEMPORARY GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES IN ICE-FREE VALLEYS.  Michael C. Malin, 
Arizona State University.

Scientists have studied the geologic and geomorphologic history of the 
ice-free valleys of southern Victoria Land but have not addressed in detail 
the nature and rate of ongoing physical and chemical processes.  During the 
1983-1984 austral summer we established test sites to examine wind erosion, 
desert-pavement formation, chemical and physical modification of rock 
materials, and the relationships of these processes to landform development. 
One of our goals is to provide information for various time scales, begin-
ning with 2 months and continuing up to 40 years.  Because during the 1984 
austral winter our test materials and collectors were severely damaged, we

- 138 -
believe that yearly repairs are necessary during the first 5 years of this
experiment.  This austral summer we will visit 10 test sites to repair our
equipment and collect samples; the status of each site and the materials
removed will be documented.  To obtain additional data, we will drill cores
from weathered boulders and outcrops.  We also will collect samples at a
site in the Allan Hills.  The samples will be analyzed by x-ray diffraction,
optical inspection, mineralogical analysis, particle-size distribution and
other sedimentological methods, and topographic and microtopographic meteor-
ological modeling.  Scanning electron microscopy will be important for
studying surfaces (exposed and freshly created) and crystal interfaces, as
we identify initial phenomena associated with abrasion and physical and
chemical alteration of rock material.  This information should help in
understanding how these valleys are changing and how to predict the
evolution of the region.

DEFORMATION DURING THE BEARDMORE AND ROSS OROGENIES, NIMROD GLACIER AREA,
ANTARCTICA.  Edmund Stump, Arizona State University.

From the late Precambrian to Ordovician, the Transantarctic Mountains
underwent a period of intense deformation identified as the Ross Orogen.
Geologists recognize two phases of activity--the Ross Orogeny (500 to 570
million years ago), which affected region with deformation, metamorphism,
and intrusion, and the Beardmore Orogeny (580 to 650 million years ago),
which caused a sequence of marine clastic rocks, known as the Beardmore
Group, to be folded.  The late Precambrian deformation has been identified
in an unique area near the Nimrod Glacier where late Precambrian Goldie
Formation (Beardmore Group) is unconformably overlain by Cambrian Shackleton
Limestone (Byrd Group).  From various investigations we know that the
Beardmore Group was deformed and eroded before the Early Cambrian deposition
of the Byrd Group and that the Byrd Group was folded during the Ross
Orogeny.  Our objective is to determine how the Beardmore and Ross Orogenies
affected the Beardmore Group.  Working near Nimrod Glacier, we will attempt
to distinguish and characterize these two episodes of deformation in the
Beardmore Group.  We will map the structure of the Beardmore Group and
Shackleton Limestone by trace structures in the Shackleton Limestone down
into the Beardmore Group and across the area where they come in contact.
The relative effects of both folding events should be apparent.  Samples
collected in the field will be analyzed petrographically to determine
microstructures and metamorphic grade.  Beardmore Group samples will be
analyzed for major and trace elements and compared to the geochemistry of
sediments from known tectonic settings.

DRY VALLEY REAL-TIME TELEMETRY SEISMOLOGY.  Nicholas A. Orsini and L. G.
Holcomb, U. S. Geological Survey Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory.

The availability of high quality seismic data from Antarctica is a long-term
objective of many investigators.  Such data, when combined with data from
the Worldwide Seismological Network, would provide needed azimuthal control
for locating seismic events in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
During the 1983-1984 austral summer we surveyed sites in southern Victoria

- 139 -
Land's ice-free valleys.  In the upcoming austral summer we will instal1 two 
borehole seismometers in Wright Valley for long-term monitoring of seismic 
events.  Recorders will be installed at New Zealand's Scott Base on Ross 
Island to relay data. Data will be transmitted in real time via a synchro-
nous satellite to the U. S. Geological Survey Albuquerque Seismological 
Laboratory as part of a larger seismic data collection network.

STRATIGRAPHIC EVOLUTION AND TECTONIC SETTING OF THE CARBONATE PLATFORMS OF 
THE ROSS SEQUENCE, TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS.  A. J. Rowe11, University of 
Kansas.

Although over the last two decades geologists have completed initial 
reconnaissance of the Transantarctic Mountains, the depositional history of 
the platforms underlying the mountains is poorly understood. Focusing on 
the carbonate platform rocks of the Ross Sequence, we will determine their 
stratigraphic age, depositional environment, morphology, and regional 
setting.  These rocks, important to understanding the evolution of the 
orogenic belt that bordered the east antarctic craton in the Early 
Paleozoic, represent the final depositional phase of the orogen.  The 
formation of the sequence was initiated by the collapse of a clastic wedge, 
which was formed by Vendian deformation of late Precambrian clastic, 
continental-margin sediments. The sequence's tectonic setting is contro-
versial; intracontinental rift or back-arc basin sites have been suggested. 
The carbonate-platform rocks were deposited near the east antarctic craton 
margin and, although deformed, have not been severely altered.  Their age, 
however, is poorly defined. Our objective during this second year of field 
work is to concentrate on the Ross Sequence in the central Transantarctic 
Mountains. We will work at sites near the Shackleton and Beardmore 
glaciers, on Bartrum and Cotton plateaus, and on the east and west sides of 
the Holyoake Range between the Nimrod and Starshot glaciers. While in the 
field, we will collect rock samples for lithology and fossil studies. 
Reconnaissance reports indicate greater faunal diversity exits here than has 
been recorded in the primary literature. By combining paleontology and 
sedimentology, we will be better able to determine the age of the sequence.

INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MCMURDO VOLCANIC GROUP AND THE ASSOCIATED ULTRAMAFIC 
XENOLITHS. Philip R. Kyle, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.

Continuing research conducted over the last 3 years, we will map and sample 
late Cenozoic alkali volcanic rocks of the McMurdo Volcanic Group. Our 
objective is to understand the distribution, petrogenesis, and chronology of 
volcanic rocks from Minna Bluff, Mt. Terror, Mt. Morning, Cape Bird, and 
Cape Crozier. At Minna Bluff, we discovered a major glacial unconformity 
formed by erosion of the Ross Ice Shelf. We will map this area to determine 
the extent of the unconformity and to collect samples for radiometric 
dating. At the sites listed above and in the foothills of the Royal Society 
Mountains, we will study mantle-derived ultramafic xenoliths. These xeno-
liths provide geochemical and petrologic data on the nature of the subcon-
tinental mantle in the McMurdo Sound region.

PETROGENESIS OF THE FERRAR SUPERGROUP AND PROVENANCE OF NEOGENE TILL IN THE
TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS.  Gunter Faure and Teresa M. Mensing, Ohio State
University.

The basalt flows and dolerite sills of the Ferrar Supergroup were formed
when rocks in the lithospheric mantle under Antarctica melted during the
break-up of Gondwana.  We believe that the resulting magma was later
contaminated by granitic rocks in the continent's crust as it simultaneously
rose towards the surface and crystallized minerals. This explanation is
based on our previous investigations of basalt flows in northern Victoria
Land.  Our objective this austral summer is to study the basalt flows and
the dolerite sills at the same time so that we can confirm our theory of the
origin of the flows and include the sills in this theory. While working in
the Beardmore Glacier region, we will collect samples for isotopic and geo-
chemical analysis. By understanding the origin of these rocks in Antarctica
we hope to learn what happens when continents break apart to form oceans.
Also, we will use the same isotopic and chemical measurements to determine
the sources of sediments that were deposited by glaciers, flowing over the
peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains more than 3 million years ago. These
data will help other scientists to explain why these glacial deposits that
are now 3,000 meters above sea level contain marine microfossils. The
explanations that have been proposed require major revisions in scientific
understanding of the glacial history of Antarctica and imply that the growth
of continental ice sheets in Antarctica affect the level of the oceans and
global climate.

ORIGINS OF SALTS IN THE ICE-FREE VALLEYS OF SOUTHERN VICTORIA LAND BY
CHLORINE-36.  Fred M. Phillips, New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology, Harold Bentley, University of Arizona, and David Elmore,
University of Rochester.

Although over the last 20 years scientists have documented the saline
characteristics of the lakes, other water, and deposits in southern Victoria
Land's ice-free valleys, the source of these salts is uncertain. Several
possible sources have been suggested--trapped seawater, local atmospheric
deposition, glacial meltwater, thermal springs, deep ground-water discharge,
weathering, or a combination of these.  In most of these studies investi-
gators have identified the chemical composition of potential salt sources
and then attempted to determine the processes that might transport the salts
to the lakes. Unfortunately, most results have been ambiguous because
specifics cannot be identified in this way. Our objective is to trace the
origins of chloride in these salts by using a chlorine isotope, chlorine-36.
Chloride is a predominant anion in most water in the ice-free valleys.
Chlorine-36 provides a simple method of directly tracing the origins of
chloride because each of the possible salt sources should have a distinctive
chlorine-36/chloride ratio. By analyzing samples from Don Juan Pond, we
already have determined that the chloride in this water is probably a
mixture of deep ground-water discharge and atmospheric deposition.  In

- 141 -
addition to tracing the origins of chloride, we will construct chloride 
balances for the lakes from chlorine-36/chloride ratios and attempt to 
determine the origins of other ionic solutes with the aid of the chloride 
balances.

GEOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF PALEOZOIC GRANITIC ROCKS OF THE CENTRAL 
TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS.  Donald J. DePaolo, University of California, Los 
Angeles.

In the central Transantarctic Mountains between the Nimrod and Beardmore 
glaciers, a segment of exposed rock appears to straddle the boundary between 
old Precambrian craton and late Precambrian geosynclinal sediments.  Also, 
in this region the Paleozoic batholith clearly overlaps the edge of 
Precambrian basement.  During a petrological and geochemical study, we will 
map and sample rocks in the Miller Range and at the Lowery and Robb glaciers 
(near the mouth of the Nimrod Glacier).  Our objectives are to understand 
the petrogenesis of the granitic rocks, to investigate the age and origin of 
the Precambrian basement rocks, and to develop tectonic-magmatic models of 
early Paleozoic evolution of the continental margin.  Because igneous rocks 
intrude into both geosynclinal metasedimentary rocks and Precambrian 
crystalline basement in this region, we are able to use neodymium-
strontium-oxygen isotopic systematics to assess what role crustal assimi-
lation had in the origin of Transantarctic granitic magmas.  Using neodymium 
and strontium isotopic systems, we will determine the age and vertical 
structure of the Precambrian basement rocks about which little is known.  
Our analytical work will include electron microprobe analysis, tests for 
major and trace elements, chemical separation, and isotopic analysis.  The 
results of this study should help explain the petrologic evolution of the 
Transantarctic Mountains.

VLF WAVE-PARTICLE EXPERIMENTS ON THE MAGNETOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE FROM SIPLE 
STATION.  R.A. Helliwell, Stanford University.

Controlled wave injection from the ground enables scientists to design and 
invent new wave-particle interactions, as well as observe and analyze the 
function of these interactions. With these techniques scientists have 
acquired important quantitative information on the nature of wave-particle 
interactions in plasma under conditions that could not have been created in 
a laboratory.  When Siple Station opens in November 1985, we will begin a 
2-year investigation of wave-particle interaction in the magnetosphere and 
ionosphere.  Our objective is to understand natural and manmade magneto-
spheric very-low-frequency (VLF) phenomena and magnetospheric thermal plasma 
structure and dynamics.  After modifying the Siple transmitter and recon-
figuring the antenna, we will use this system to study the effect of signal 
polarization on wave excitation in the magnetosphere, ground-to-ground 
propagation outside the plasmapause, the response of the magnetosphere as

- 142 -
function of injected signal level, the response to signals with varying 
degrees of coherence, and the effect of ionospheric structure on wave-
injection experiments. To investigate VLF wave-induced precipitation in the 
ionosphere, we will search with a high-frequency radar for ionization-
density changes and use the Siple transmitter signal to probe the earth-
ionosphere propagation path to other antarctic stations.  These experiments 
provide data that help us to better understand coherent radiation from 
plasma.  These data are important to laboratory plasma physics and astro-
physics, as well as magnetospheric physics.  The results also can be applied 
to communications (both extremely-low-frequency and high-frequency systems), 
remote sensing of magnetospheric plasma, and modification of the magneto-
sphere and ionosphere by wave-induced particle precipitation.

FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER INVESTIGATIONS IN ANTARCTICA.  L. J. Lanzerotti, Bell 
Laboratories.

Over the last decade, fluxgate magnetometers have been instrumental in 
studying hydromagnetic wave phenomena in the magnetosphere.  At South Pole 
Station we use a magnetometer to examine the types of hydromagnetic waves 
produced in the cusp region of the magnetosphere.  Hydromagnetic wave data 
from South Pole is combined with data from riometers, photometers, an iono-
sonde, and the all-sky camera to better understand the processes in the 
magnetospheric-cusp region.  Because South Pole provides outstanding 
climatic conditions for extended optical observations, we are able to 
correlate optical measurements with particle precipitation and hydromagnetic 
wave phenomena recorded by the magnetometer.  The fluxgate magnetometer, 
installed near McMurdo Station in 1983-1984, was relocated to Arrival 
Heights during the 1984-1985 austral summer with assistance from University 
of Maryland researchers.  This austral summer we will continue to conduct 
experiments from this site.

MAGNETIC PULSATION STUDIES AT MCMURDO, SIPLE, AND AMUNDSEN-SCOTT SOUTH POLE 
STATIONS.  Roger L. Arnoldy, University of New Hampshire, and Laurence J. 
Cahill, University of Minnesota.

Since 1973 we have operated digital micropulsation stations at remote sites 
in Antarctica and the Northern Hemisphere to obtain data on how ultra-low-
frequency (ULF) waves are generated and propagated in the magnetosphere.  
These data are compared with data on wave spectra, amplitudes, and polari-
zations at opposite ends of a magnetic field line.  During the 1985-1986 
austral summer we will check and calibrate stations at the South Pole and 
McMurdo stations and install sensors at Siple Station.  Our projects include 
defining ULF activity at South Pole, correlating Dynamics Explorer-1 satel-
lite data with Siple/Roberval and South Pole data, and studying emissions at 
or near the plasmapause.  To study the propagation of ULF waves through the 
ionosphere, we will take measurements while the Dynamics Explorer-1 satel-
lite is in range of South Pole Station.  We will try through simultaneous 
cusp measurements to identify the ULF cusp, define how it is controlled by

- 143 -
the interplanetary medium, and study ULF generation at or near the plasma-
pause during solar minimum. We also will simultaneously observe the polar
cap and auroral zone/cusp to distinguish ULF waves generated by the magneto-
spheric tail from signals ducted from the auroral oval and cusp.

BALLOON-BORNE INVESTIGATION OF THE IONOSPHERIC ELECTRIC FIELD AT THE
GEOGRAPHIC SOUTH POLE.  Edgar A. Bering, University of Houston--University
Park.

The magnetospheric cusp is the region on the dayside of the magnetosphere
where the configuration of the Earth's magnetic field changes significantly.
The motions and microstructures of this region, a major internal boundary of
the magnetosphere, have broad implications for magnetospheric dynamics.  A
significant part of the energy and momentum that drive magnetospheric
processes are injected from the solar wind through the cusp. Processes in
the cusp produce dayside aurora, and propagation down cusp field lines is
one way that magnetopause ultra-low-frequency waves penetrate the magneto-
sphere. Our research focuses on the ionospheric electric field near the
cusp. Because this field drives the convection motions of the plasma, it is
a sensitive indicator of magnetospheric dynamics. To obtain data, we will
launch 10 high-altitude instrumented balloons from Amundsen-Scott South Pole
Station. Each balloon will carry an electric field detector (provided by
the University of Houston) and a x-ray Bremsstrahlung detector (provided by
the University of Maryland). With the assistance of University of Maryland
researchers, we will investigate the conjugacy of the electric field with
northern hemisphere radar observations and the response of the very-high-
latitude dayside electric field to isolated substorms. We also will try to
obtain sufficient data for statistically significant study of correlations
with other parameters such as the interplanetary magnetic field.

An image intensified all-sky camera, installed in 1982 at South Pole

produces images of weak optical emissions at the latitude of the cusp, an
important but poorly understood boundary region of the Earth's magneto-
sphere. This austral summer we will inspect and do maintance work on this
equipment. The system will be operated and maintained by South Pole
personnel during the austral winter.

stratospheric winds in the McMurdo area and of the generating mechanism for 
auroral infrasonic waves.  The spaced array of sensitive microphones at 
Windless Bight on the Ross Ice Shelf will be returned to the United States

COSMIC RAY INTENSITY VARIATIONS.  Martin A. Pomerantz, Bartol Research 
Foundation, University of Delaware.

Cosmic rays provide a powerful tool for studying exotic astrophysical 
processes that occur on the Sun and in its far reaching atmosphere that con-

probing interplanetary plasma dynamics through observations of variations in 
relativistic (over 1 gigaelectron-volt) galactic cosmic rays.  At McMurdo 
and South Pole Stations, we will continue year-round observations of cosmic 
radiation and collaborate with the magnetospheric cusp program.  This 
austral summer, we also will extend the South Pole cosmic ray tower and its 
platform. Our objective is to obtain high quality observations with the 
ultimate time resolution that has been attained by other upper atmosphere 
programs at U. S. antarctic stations.  To enhance our understanding of the 
solar physical processes that control the electromagnetic conditions in the 
Earth's environment, our data are used in conjunction with data from other 
ground-based instruments and spacecraft.

RIOMETRY IN ANTARCTICA AND CONJUGATE REGIONS.  Theodore J. Rosenberg,
University of Maryland.

A riometer, or relative ionospheric opacity meter, provides continuous data 
economically on temporal and spatial variations of energetic electron 
precipitation and ionospheric irregularities. Our investigation focuses on 
riometer measurements of particle precipitation and ionospheric perturba-
tions associated with the cusp, auroral oval, and the polar cap ionosphere. 
During the 1985-1986 austral summer we will install 20 megaherz riometers 
at Siple Station and operate riometers at South Pole and McMurdo stations. 
At South Pole Station we will acquire data for very-low-frequency, fluxgate 
magnetometer, micropulsation, and photometer research in a common format and 
will assist scientists in correlating their analyses of complex ionospheric 
and magnetospheric phenomena. We also will inspect and make necessary 
adjustments to the South Pole riometer antenna and select a

the riometer antenna at Arrival Heights area. Common format recordings also

Working with investigators from the University of Texas (S-103), we will
provide and prepare five x-ray experiments to be launched in balloons from
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. We will provide some ground-station and
launching equipment and help to launch and monitor these experiments.  From
these experiments we will obtain data on electron precipitation in the
magetospheric cusp and auroral regions that pass over the South Pole each
day.  These data will be correlated with electric-field data obtained by the
University of Houston investigators.

SOUTH POLE OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS.  Robert H. Eather, Boston College.

We will continue to operate a two-color "keogram" camera and two-channel
zenithal photometer at the South Pole to continously monitor auroral
intensity and the average electron energy that crosses the South Pole
geomagnetic meridian during the austral winter. The camera records the
distribution of two auroral emissions along the magnetic meridian and
monitors the character, position, and dynamics of polar cusp aurora.
Because of its spectrum discriminating capability, this camera is uniquely
suited for displaying the position and motion of the cusp and auroral oval.
The photometer monitors low-level auroral emissions that can be correlated
with riometer measurements. Since 1981 we have broadened the range of our
research by working with investigators who are using magnetometers,
ionospheric sounders, and riometers at the South Pole.  These data are being
combined with global images taken by the Dynamics Explorer-1 satellite over
the South Pole during the 1983 austral winter.

IONOSONDE STUDIES OF THE CUSP IONOSPHERE.  F. T. Berkey and J. R. Doupnik,
Utah State University.

Plasma instabilities and precipitation effects are produced in the
ionosphere by solar winds as they penetrate the magnetosphere through the
magnetospheric cusp. Research has established that the cusp region, where
particles with energies typical of magnetosheath plasma are present, is
longitudinally elongated. It is composed of down streaming plasma from the
entry layer, upstreaming plasma that has been mirrored, and upward streaming
ions and electrons of magnetospheric origin.  The discovery of this magneto-
sheath-like plasma precipitation has drawn special attention to the dayside
ionosphere; such precipitation causes the structure and dynamics of the
dayside ionosphere to vary rapidly.  Because these ionospheric disturbances
cause electron density irregularities (reflected vertically as incident
radio waves), we can measure these variations by means of an ionosonde

- 146 -
(ionospheric sounder).  These measurements provide year-round, detailed 
information on the structure and dynamics of the ionosphere.  By operating 
an ionosonde at the South Pole, we can determine the ionospheric signature 
of the low-energy magnetosheath precipitation, estimate the size and 
location of the resulting ionospheric perturbation, and determine the lati-
tudinal and longitudinal extent of the perturbation.  Our investigation will 
provide a better understanding of the role of magnetosheath-particle entry 
in the physics of the magnetosphere.  We also will operate an all-sky 
camera, which records the dynamics of visible aurora by making exposures at 
a rate of one per minute.  Visible auroral emissions are a direct manifes-
tation of low-energy electrons precipitating into dayside ionosphere.  
Because light emissions are generally weak, typical exposure times are 
usually several seconds.  These color photographs will provide the necessary 
data to study the dynamics and morphology of the low-energy magnetosheath 
precipitation region.

AUTOMATED PHOTOMETRY OF SELECTED STARS AT THE SOUTH POLE.  Frank Wood,
University of Florida.

Astronomical observations of celestial objects undergoing such changes as 
brightness, color, spectral type, or polarization of emitted radiation are 
hindered by daylight or starset interruptions.  For photometric studies of 
binary star systems or observations of comets and asteroids this is parti-
cularly true.  South Pole Station provides an ideal location for such 
observations, because in this region the elevations of stars do not vary and 
the world's longest nights exist.  During the 1984 austral winter, we tested 
an automated, 8-centimeter telescope system to monitor photoelectrially four 
stars at several wave lengths.  The nature of one star, a close binary 
system, is not understood, and we gathered data on its light variation and 
changes in certain helium and carbon emissions.  Observations of the other 
three stars were collected for comparison with the first star.  Because of 
structural design deficiencies, the telescope was dismantled during the 
1984-1985 austral summer.  This austral summer we will install an optical 
astronomical telescope, which we have redesigned, test and aline this 
system, and survey the site for possible light pollution from South Pole 
station during the winter.  We also will test the data retrieval system and 
develop procedures for transmitting selected data via satellite during the 
winter.

ICE CORE DRILLING.  Karl C. Kuivinen, University of Nebraska.

Ice cores provide valuable information on past atmospheric constituents and 
climate.  During the 1985-1986 austral summer, we will conduct hot-water 
drilling of seismic shot holes on ice stream C along the Siple Coast for 
University of Wisconsin investigators (S-151).  We also will drill two 
shallow-depth cores near Siple Station for investigators from Ohio State

- 147 -
University (S-171). These cores will be approximately 250 meters, although 
the capability of the drill and the quality of the core will determine how 
deep we drill. If there is enough time, we will also go to Byrd Surface 
Camp and log the borehole from which a 2,164-meter core was taken in 1968.

GLACIOGEOPHYSICAL STUDY OF THE INTERIOR ROSS SEA EMBAYMENT.  Charles R.
Bentley, University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The dynamics of the west antarctic ice sheet are important for glaciology 
and world climatology. Glaciologists investigate ice stream dynamics, ice 
physics, glacier sliding laws, and the ice sheet's history; climatologists 
gain an understanding of the relationship between the ice sheet's stability 
and climatic warming, information vital to understanding global atmospheric 
dynamics. Although glaciologists generally agree that the present size of 
the west antarctic ice sheet is reduced in comparison to its Wisconsin 
maximum, they disagree about the magnitude of change and the past locations 
of its seaward edge. This austral summer we will study the present-day 
state of the ice sheet, assess its dynamic behavior over the last few 
thousand years, and conduct a multi-phase geophysical survey around the 
Siple Coast. We will carry out radar sounding of the ice sheet and its 
basal surface and aeromagnetic surveys from a Twin Otter airplane. These 
surveys will be done over ice streams B and C and the catchment area; 
continued at Crary Ice Rise and ice streams B and C. We will do seismic 
shooting and electrical resistivity sounding of the ice sheet and bedrock to 
gather information about internal and subglacial physical characteristics. 
Using a grid network, we will survey gravity and magnetics of the region's 
subglacial geology.

ICE DYNAMICS ON THE MARINE BYRD LAND SLOPE.  Ian M. Whillans, Ohio State 
University Research Foundation.

Various theories about the present state of the west antarctic ice sheet 
have been published. Among these are that the ice sheet is presently 
recovering from a surge, that it is now surging, or that it is about to 
surge. The proposed triggers for these actions are climate change, sea-
level rise, atmospheric rebound, and internal instability. Our research is 
designed to measure the mass balance of part of the west antarctic ice sheet 
and to study its dynamics, especially the dynamics of the ice streams. To 
obtain data about the ice sheet's mass balance, we will measure outflow by 
using satellite receivers and input by collecting ice core samples to 
determine nuclear fallout levels. To study dynamics we will measure defor-
mation patterns to determine where the resistive drag to glacial flow is 
manifest. During the 1984-1985 austral summer we established velocity 
station on ice stream B and took aerial photographs, made a tractor traverse 
across the entrance to this ice stream, and established velocity stations in 
the catchment to ice streams B and C. This austral summer we will resurvey 
the catchment area and the upper parts of ice streams B and C. We also will 
work closely with investigators from the University of Wisconsin (S-151A) 
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (S-173).

GLACIOLOGICAL AND CLIMATOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PAST 2,000 YEARS FROM
ANTARCTIC ICE CORES.  Ellen Mosley-Thompson, Lonnie G. Thompson, and Thomas
R. Sweet, Ohio State University.

Recent analysis of intermediate-depth (500 meters or more) ice cores, which
record Late Wisconsin and Holocene climate, demonstrate that large-scale
climate fluctuations, such as glacial and interglacial periods, occur at
approximately the same time worldwide.  Paleoclimatic investigations
indicate that records in ice cores, tree rings, and lake sed iments can be
used to resolve short-term climate variations.  Because of paleoclimatic
reconstructions based on these short-term records, scientists believe that
climatic events once thought to be regional are local manifestations of
global climate fluctuations. Our objective is to understand the climatic
and glacial conditions prevalent in Antarctica over the last 2,000 years and
to establish the degree of spatial and temporal coherence in climate
variations around Antarctica. To obtain data, drillers will retrieve two
ice cores about 250 meters long from sites near Siple Station.  Such
shallow-depth ice cores document climate variations since the Holocene, are
essential for interpreting longer records, and, as some scientists believe,
may provide important data for predicting future climates.  Near the coring
site we will excavate a pit, map visual stratigraphy, and collect additional
samples for analysis. Our field analysis will be limited to photographic
documentation of the core stratigraphy; in our laboratory we will analyze
samples for concentration and size distribution of insoluble particulates
and use ion chromatography to study specific ion species. The concentration
and chemical nature of these particulates provide information about the
types of atmospheric particulates deposited during the time recorded in the
ice cores.  In South Pole and Dome C ice cores the concentrations of
insoluble particulates exhibit a seasonal cycle, which, we believe, should
be present in the Siple cores. This annual cycle can be used to establish a
relative time-scale for the Siple cores.  Our objective is to combine the
antarctic data with data from cores obtained in South America, Greenland,
Alaska, and China. This combination will enable us to begin synthesizing
worldwide climate variations over the last 2,000 years.

WEST ANTARCTIC GLACIOLOGY. Robert A. Bindschadler, Goddard Laboratory for
Atmospheric Sciences, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The size of the marine-based west antarctic ice sheet has fluctuated greatly
over time, but little is known about how much it fluctuated or what its
present dynamic behavior is. The minimum extent of the ice sheet probably
occured about 125,000 years ago when only a small part of the ice sheet was
grounded and sea level was approximately 5 meters higher than today. Its
maximum extent may have been 18,000 years ago when scientists believe that
the ice sheet was 50 percent larger than today and the grounded ice sheet
reached the continental margin's edge.  Our objective is to assess the
present dynamic state of ice in West Antarctica near ice stream B on the
Siple Coast. We also will gather data on ice dynamics at the junction of
grounded and floating ice to determine what factors control ice streams
flowing through surrounding ice and into the ice shelves, as well as the
factors controlling ice shelves as they flow over or around submarine

- 149 -
mountains.  Using snowmobiles and a Twin Otter airplane, we will resurvey 
surface stakes at a site on ice stream B, in the catchment basin, and around 
the Crary Ice Rise.  With these data we will determine ice velocity and 
deformation at the point where ice stream B enters the Ross Ice Shelf. 
Also, we will measure the north edge of ice stream B to determine the width 
of the area where intense shearing occurs.  Mass balance measurements in the 
catchment basin will help us to calculate the state of balance for the 
entire basin of ice stream B.  From this investigation we hope to assess 
whether the ice sheet is thickening or thinning, how the ice shelf interacts 
with the ice streams, what the stresses are within the ice shelf near a 
major ice rise, and how the ice streams might behave in the future.

STRATIGRAPHY, PALEONTOLOGY, AND SEDIMENTOLOGY OF THE SIRIUS FORMATION,
BEARDMORE GLACIER REGION, ANTARCTICA.  Peter N. Webb and John H. Mercer,
Ohio State University.

In 1983 while studying Cenozoic glacial drift samples (Sirius Formation)
collected 15 years earlier, we discovered that the samples contained marine
microfossils between 2 million and 70 million years old.  The samples had 
been collected in the Transantarctic Mountains 2,500 meters above sea level
near the Reedy and Beardmore glaciers and Mount Feather.  Outcrops of Sirius
Formation sediments have been found between the Reedy Glacier in the south
to the Mackay Glacier in the north.  Near the Beardmore Glacier, which is
halfway between the Reedy and Mackay glaciers, is the Dominion Range where
the thickest, most extensive exposures of the Sirius Formation in the
Transantarctic Mountains are found.  Based at the Beardmore South camp this
austral summer, we will continue to investigate the formation's strati-
graphy, paleontology, and sedimentary geology.  We will describe, sample,
and map Sirius Formation sediments and younger and recent moraines at sites
in the Dominion Range and other sites near the Beardmore Glacier.  After
returning to the United States, we will analyze the samples for microfossils
(particularly diatoms and foraminifera) and sedimentary composition.  We
will use the microfossil to determine the maximum deposition for the
formation at each site, to provide range of ages for recycled microfossils,
and to indicate the sedimentary phases of areas where the microfossils
originated.  In addition to sedimentary analyses, which includes grain-size
determinations and pebble and matrix mineralogy, we will search for non-
Transantarctic Mountain rock fragments and rocks that might have economic
significance.  Our objective is to recognize and date phases of Sirius
Formation deposition, relate these to the glacial history of the Trans-
antarctic Mountains, and correlate these data with the late Cenozoic glacial
history that has been established for the Ross Sea margin of the
Transantarctic Mountains.

MARINE GEOLOGY OF THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA CONTINENTAL MARGIN.  John B.
Anderson, Rice University.

Since 1979 we have worked to describe the sediment types that blanket the
antarctic sea floor and to relate the sedimentary facies to glacial and
oceanographic conditions. This austral summer we will focus on the
continental margin between the South Orkney Plateau and Marguerite Bay.
While aboard the USCG Glacier, we will take piston cores and conduct a
single-channel seismic survey. Our objectives are to examine and describe
the mechanisms by which terrigenous sediment are carried from the
continental shelf to the deep sea floor, to investigate sedimentary glacial
record preserved in marine sections of the continental shelf. Data from
these studies will help us to understand the glacial marine sedimentologic
process and to interpret the sedimentary record. Sample locations and
descriptions of materials collected will be made available to other
investigators through the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility at
Florida State University and through publication.

SEDIMENTS DEPOSITED BY MARINE ICE SHEETS IN THE ROSS, WEDDELL, AMUNDSEN, AND
BARENTS SEAS DURING THE GLACIAL MAXIMUM:  A TEST OF THE MAXIMUM MODEL.
Thomas B. Kellogg and Davida E. Kellogg, University of Maine.

Previous studies in the Weddell and Ross seas suggest that information about
physical changes in the ocean are recorded in diatom assemblages that have
frozen sequentially into the sea ice during the preceeding winter. One of
our objectives is to compare the diatom distribution patterns that we
observed in Weddell Sea ice with those in Ross Sea ice.  If quantifiable
relationships between ocean conditions and diatom distribution patterns can
be demonstrated, these relationships will have important implications for
modern and paleo-oceanographic investigations. We also may be able to
describe general characteristics for all antarctic sea ice. We will sample
diatom distributions in the surface and near-surface waters of the Ross Sea
and relate these distributions to the near-surface hydrology.  Ideally,
our sampling will begin where the surface water temperature drops to 10C.
This isotherm was chosen because recent investigations determined that
temperature is an important factor in photosynthetic rates. To determine
water temperature, we will deploy eight expendable bathythermographs (XBTs)
every 5o of latitude south 48o and at or near the Ross Ice Shelf. We will
routinely take water and sea-ice core samples when deploying the XBTs;
water-column samples will be taken at the surface and at depths of 5, 50,
and 100 meters. During the cruise we will continuously monitor the diatom
content of both water samples and ice cores. If certain diatom assemblages
consistently are associated with specific ocean conditions, we will be able
to use ice diatoms to study the oceanography and climate of Antarctica and
will be able to monitor winter surface water conditions.  Sea-ice
communities found in sediments should provide similar information on a
geologic time scale.

MARINE SOURCES OF ANTARCTIC SULFATE AEROSOL.  Robert Duce, University of
Rhode Island, and Alexander A. P. Pszenny and James N. Galloway, University
of Virginia.

Sulfur in the form of sulfate constitutes an average of 80 to 90 percent of
the atmospheric aerosol over Antarctica.  Past investigations have shown
that crustal weathering, sea salts, oxidation of atmospheric constituents,
stratospheric aerosols, and volcanism do not appear to account for more than
two-thirds of this sulfur.  Although it hasn't been confirmed, the avail-
able data strongly suggest that much of this sulfur may be derived from
marine biogenic dimethyl sulfide. Our objective is to investigate the
hypothesis that reduced sulfur gases produced by antarctic phytoplankton may
be a major source.  Working in the Drake Passage, Bransfield Strait, and
the Scotia and Weddell seas, we will determine the concentrations of gaseous
sulfur dioxide, aerosol methane sulfuric acid, and aerosol non-sea-salt
sulfate in the marine boundary layer.  These data will be combined with
simultaneous reduced-sulfur-gas concentration data and estimates of oceanic
emission rates to better understand how sulfur is oxidized in the marine
atmosphere. We also will estimate how much of this hypothesized marine
source of sulfur contributes to the sulfate-dominated atmospheric aerosol.

METEOROLOGY

(S-255)
AEROSOL TRANSPORT PROCESSES AND METEOROLOGICAL VARIATION.  Austin Hogan,
State University of New York, Albany.

The ice in Antarctica acts as a sink and a temporary storage reservoir for
particulate matter, certain gases, and vapors that precipitate from the air
as it passes over the continent.  The precipitation of these materials to
the ice is important to the stability of several physical properties of the
atmosphere, but the precipitation mechanisms and the frequency with which
they act are not well understood.  Near South Pole Station we will use a
30-meter meteorological tower and special instrumentation, as well as
"end-point" aerosols over Antarctica and the water-vapor mixing ratio of
polar air.  Our observations will be coordinated with meteorological and
radiation measurements to estimate climatological significance.  From these
data we will estimate the flux of particles to the ice and determine some
fundamental properties of aerosols, which can be measured only in a pristine
atmosphere.  For 10 days during the early austral summer, we will conduct
similar experiments near the Beardmore Glacier.  Also, we will help select a
site near Arrival Heights, which is above McMurdo Station and will work with
investigators from the University of Wisconsin to establish a new automatic
weather station system on the polar plateau near South Pole Station.

GEOPHYSICAL MONITORING FOR CLIMATIC CHANGE.  James T. Peterson,
Environmental Research Laboratories, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

Our field team will continue long-term measurements of trace atmospheric
constituents that may influence climate. Two wintering personnel will
measure carbon dioxide, surface ozone, winds, pressure, air and snow
temperature, atmospheric moisture, and other trace constituents from the
station's clean air facility. The objectives for this project are to
determine the rate at which concentrations of these atmospheric constituents
change and to examine sources, sinks, and budgets. Working with climate
modelers and diagnosticians, we will use these data to determine how the
rate of change in aerosol concentrations affects climate.  In support of
this project, personnel at Palmer Station will collect carbon dioxide
samples for us.

BOUNDARY LAYER STUDIES IN TERRA NOVA BAY.  David H. Bromwich, Ohio State
University.

Persistent winter katabatic (or gravity-driven) winds blow across Terra Nova
Bay's western shore and clear the sea ice out of the bay.  Nearby the
Drygalski Ice Tongue prevents pack ice from drifting north into the bay.
Strong winds, mostly associated with cyclones, move the sea ice and modify
the amount of open water. In the bay about once a month during the winter,
a polynya as large as 5,000 square kilometers forms. This polynya is the
first example of katabatic winds having a primary role in creating a polynya
and may maintain the region's high-salinity shelf water. This water mass,
the densest water mass on the antarctic continental shelf, contributes to
basal melting of the Ross Ice Shelf, blocks cross-shelf transport of
relatively warm water from the circumpolar deep water, and forms high-
salinity bottom water at the continental margin. During the 1985-1986
austral summer we will study the meteorology of this region from a Coast
Guard icebreaker.  With these data we will test and refine a model that we
have developed to describe the generation and modulation of winter open
water in Terra Nova Bay. The katabatic winds, apparently a small-scale
version of the strong coastal katabatic winds in Adelie Land, extend approx-
imately 25 kilometers beyond the end of the main ice sheet slope; typical
katabatic winds do not persist more than a few kilometers. We will document
and analyze the dynamics of the bay's katabatic winds, describe the western
Ross Sea barrier winds, and define what part the latter winds have in
creating the polynya. In 1979 infrared satellite imagery and surface
synoptic maps indicated that cyclones formed and persisted along the
Victoria Land coast, particularly in or near Terra Nova Bay. To identify
what role the polynya may have in cyclone formation in this area, we will
determine how often cyclones occur and what causes them. Besides data
obtained during our field work, we will use data from two automatic weather
stations near the bay and from thermal infrared imagery obtained by polar-
orbiting satellites. The results of our study will help to clarify the
atmospheric processes that form polynyas along the antarctic coast.

EMPIRICAL CORRELATION OF ICE CRYSTAL TYPES WITH HALO TYPES. Walter Tape,
University of Alaska--Fairbanks.

Refraction or reflection of sunlight through ice crystals in the atmosphere
cause atmospheric halos. Such ice-crystal halos depend on crystal shape and
orientation as well as the light-ray path within the crystal.  In the 1970s
computer-generated simulations, based on the assumed shape and orientation
of ice crystals and the assumed light path through the crystal, were
developed to predict the relationship between the types of crystals and
their orientation and types of atmospheric halos.  Although the predicted
halo shapes and intensities have been compared with real halos, the
responsible ice crystals generally have not been examined.  Atmospheric
conditions in the interior of Antarctica produce crisp, well-defined halos.
The temperature is low, the atmosphere dry and clean, and a strong low-level
inversion layer commonly occurs.  Working at South Pole Station, we will
photograph ice crystals and halos and will replicate the crystals.  We also
will document the atmospheric conditions occuring at the time the halo is
present.  By combining an understanding of the relationship between crystal
types and halo types with a knowledge of the relationship between atmos-
pheric conditions and crystal types, we may eventually be able to use halos
as a means of remote sensing of atmospheric conditions.  Although our work
will concentrate on low-level halos, we also will photograph all extensive
or unusual halos.

OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF SNOW.  Stephen G. Warren and Thomas C. Grenfell,
University of Washington.

In Antarctica the radiation budget, long recognized as the driving force of
the continent's climate, may affect not only southern hemisphere climate but
also worldwide climate.  Although scientists have measured the amount of
solar radiation transmitted back into the atmosphere, these measurements are
averaged and do not account for changes in wavelength caused by the
radiative properties of the Sun, atmosphere, and snow.  The results
of the two most thorough antarctic studies, which concentrated on the
visible light spectrum, disagree dramatically and cannot easily be used in
climate or energy-budget models.  Also, studies have shown that in snow the
presence of small amounts of pollution such as dust or graphitic carbon can
greatly alter measurements made in the near-infrared range.  For measuring
the spectral albedo, we have developed a theoretical model, which in tests
has provided accurate measurements in the near-infrared but not in the
visible light range.  Because no investigations have been conducted with
pure snow (snow with extremely small amounts of contamination), we will test
our model at sites near South Pole Station.  Using a spectrophotometer, we
establish the spectral variation of the surface albedo as a function of
wavelength.  We will use radiation measurements and analyses of light-
absorbing impurities in the snow to determine how far away from the station
experiments can be conducted and still accurately represent the polar
plateau and to learn whether earlier radiation-budget studies were
influenced by their proximity to stations.  Also we will study the effects

- 154 -
of sastrugi on the snow albedo. Models that can be used to accurately 
describe radiation and energy-budget balances in the polar regions are 
critical for studying the effects of pollutants on global climate.

MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC CONSTITUENTS.  David G. Murcray, University of 
Denver.

Antarctica may act as a sink for stratospheric constituents, particularly 
water vapor and HNO_(3). At the South Pole during several austral summers we 
have obtained infrared solar spectra, containing a large number of 
absorption features, the majority of which are due to constituents present 
in the Earth's atmosphere. The spectra can be analyzed to determine the 
total amount of these constituents.  South Pole Station is a unique ground 
site for this type of investigation because it combines high altitude and 
low water vapor concentrations that reduce the amount of atmospheric 
absorption in the infrared over the site. Although solar spectra cannot be 
obtained during the winter, similar information can be obtained from 
infrared atmospheric emission spectra. Using instruments able to measure 
infrared radiation from the atmosphere, we have monitored the chemical 
composition of the atmosphere. This instrumentation was installed at South 
Pole Station during the early part of the 1984-1985 austral summer and 
operated during the austral summer and 1985 winter.  This austral summer we 
will pack the instruments and return them and the to the United States where 
the information will be analyzed.

KATABATIC WINDS IN EAST ANTARCTICA.  Gerd Wendler and Joan P. Gosink, 
University of Alaska.

Katabatic, or gravity-driven, winds strongly influence the climate of 
Antarctica. To improve our understanding of these winds, three automatic 
weather stations were set up between Dumont d'Urville (on the coast) and 
Dome C (1,000 kilometers inland) to collect data for comparison with 
existing theoretical models. These data provide us with a better under-
standing of the seasonal variations of the katabatic wind and how synoptic 
pressure system influence katabatic winds. Working with French scientists 
who have established weather stations in and around Dumont d'Urville, we use 
kites and balloons to measure through the planetary boundary layer and will 
estimate the energy budget at three sites.  We will occupy one station about 
100 kilometers from the coast while French observers conduct similar experi-
ments at two other sites, one 20 kilometers from the coast and the other 200 
kilometers from the coast.

COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF AUTOMATIC WEATHER STATION DATA.  Charles R. 
Stearns, University of Wisconsin.

Although information taken from satellites on antarctic weather patterns is 
valuable, surface data are needed for confirmation. Automatic weather 
stations (AWS) measure surface pressure, air temperature, wind speed, and

- 155 -
wind direction and transmit the data to satellites for interrogation by 
ground stations.  During the 1985-1986 austral summer, we will remove AWS 
units in the Ross Island area; those stations on the Ross Ice Shelf, at Dome 
C, Byrd, Siple, and Dumont d'Urville stations, at the head of Byrd Glacier, 
and at Franklin Island and Terra Nova Bay will continue to operate year-
round.  We also will install four AWS units looking down the drainage of 
Beardmore Glacier, two units near Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and one 
at South Pole Station.  With these AWS units we are able to gather 
continuously reliable meteorological data that will support current and 
future meteorological studies.

AIRBORNE LIDAR STUDY OF ANTARCTIC AEROSOL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP TO METEOROLOGICAL PROCESS.  Bruce M. Morley, SRI International.

By using an airborne lidar (laser infrared radar), we will characterize 
spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol concentrations over Antarctica.  
We will analyze the resulting data in terms of atmospheric behavior.  The 
laser in the lidar, which will be carried on routine LC-130 flights in 
Antarctica and between Antarctica and New Zealand, transmits energy pulses 
at wavelengths of 1.06 and 0.53 micrometers.  This energy, backscattered 
from atmospheric molecules and reflected from the Earth's surface, is 
collected in an optical telescope and transformed into an electrical signal, 
which is digitized and recorded on magnetic tape and paper.  With the data 
from a series of firings, we can produce a vertical map of aerosol concen-
trations along the airplane's flight path.  These data also enable us to 
measure aerosol backscatter inhomogeneities caused by changes in partical 
concentration, size and shape, or composition.  We will characterize the 
frequency, height, thickness, and extent of elevated and surface-based 
aerosol layers.  From these data we will be able to identify aerosol sources 
in Antarctica and meteorological processes that affect aerosol transport.  
Although some possible sources for atmospheric aerosols, such as sea-salt 
particles, extraterrestrial dust, dust from southern hemisphere deserts, and 
exposed antarctic land areas, have been suggested, some anomalies still 
exist.  Data obtained from the lidar measurements may help to identify these 
unknown sources and provide important information for investigations of 
boundary layer dynamics and tropospheric-stratospheric exchange.

SULFURIC ACID AEROSOL PRODUCTION AT 30 KILOMETERS OVER ANTARCTICA.  David J. 
Hofmann and James M. Rosen, University of Wyoming.

Each year since 1979 we have observed that during the late winter and spring 
small sulfuric acid droplets form over the north polar regions at an 
altitude of about 30 kilometers.  In the northern hemisphere we also have 
studied the formation and growth of these droplets after volcanic eruptions. 
From these data and related observations, we have developed a model to 
describe the thermal nucleation of sulfuric acid droplets from vapors 
probably related to volcanic injections and winter transport to polar 
regions.  Data obtained during the 1983-1984 austral summer show that an 
extensive aerosol layer, consisting of aerosols similar in size to those we 
found in the northern Hemisphere, exists at altitudes between 11 and 17

- 156 -
kilometers.  These results appear to support our model of the effects of stratospheric warming on sulfuric acid and water aerosols during the austral summer.  These data enable us to better evaluate the global effects of major volcanic eruptions. During the 1985-1986 austral summer we will launch a large plastic, instrumented balloon from McMurdo and South Pole Stations to measure the conscentration of small particles in the stratosphere at altitudes up to 35 kilometers.

DEVELOPMENT OF A PARACHUTE DEPLOYABLE WEATHER STATION.  John O. Anderson,
Polar Research Laboratory, Inc..

Automatic weather stations have been used for a number of years in Antarctica to obtain year-round meteorological data from remote areas of the continent.  However, because all of these units must be deployed manually, areas of the continent where airplane landings are hazardous or too costly have been neglected. We have completed preliminary development of a parachute-deployable self-erecting weather station, which we believe will provide investigators with the capability of collecting long-term data in the most remote areas of Antarctica. Such air-dropped systems have been used successfully in the Arctic and in some areas of Antarctica.  This austral summer we hope to test the prototype model of our new system in Antarctica. The 350-pound system will operate in winds up to 100 knots and in air temperatures of -60°C.  Based on our preliminary investigation of the antarctic environment, we have designed this system to include a cross-type parachute, impact-activated cutter, and an inflatable-bag, impact-energy-absorption system. Data from this austral summer's testing will enable us to complete the design of the impact-absorbing system, program the erection-control system, and integrate the necessary electronics into the system.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW DATA ACQUISITION AND DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR THE NSF RESEARCH-CONFIGURED LC-130.  Lawrence F. Radke and Peter V. Hobbs,
University of Washington.

As part of the U. S. Antarctic Research Program, the National Science Foundation maintains one ski-equipped Hercules (LC-130) airplane that has been configured for airborne research.  The system includes sensors (similar to those used during the 1970s for hurricane research) that measure temperature, dewpoint, and pressure and determine the airplane's geographic position and fields of motion in the air surrounding the airplane.  The current data aquisition system, known as the airborne research data system (ARDS), is an analog/digital "party line" system, weighs more than 500 kilograms, and requires two technicians to operate it. By current standards, ARDS is obsolete because it is extremely heavy and labor-intensive.  We are designing and constructing a new, compact replacement, the data acquisition and display system (DADS).  DADS will use all of the existing sensors and improve operational flexibility, weight, and use.  This system combines advances in microprocessor-directed recording on formatted cartridge tapes with a microcomputer for real-time display. It does not require a dedicated operator and can be contained in two suitcase-sized

- 157 -
packages, each weighing less than 45 kilograms. After installation, DADS 
will provide a modern system for acquiring meteorological and atmospheric 
chemistry data.
