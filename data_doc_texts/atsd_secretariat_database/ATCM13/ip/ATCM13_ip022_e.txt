Exchange of Information in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty

The Netherlands programme on Antarctic research

The Netherlands will start a programme on Antarctic research during the Antarctic 
summer of 1985-1986.  The first programme will be until May 1987.  The results of 
this programme will be evaluated and a guideline for the intended, 4 years lasting, 
follow up programme.

Several Netherlands research institutes will participate in the programme.
Proposals in the following fields of research can be expected:

(I)     Nature Management;
(II)    Oceanography;
(III)   Glaciology
(IV)    Geology

see the research proposals in the annex.

Probably most research will be carried out in co-operation with the Alfred Wegener 
Institut fUr Polarforschung, Federal Republic of Germany.  Also co-operation with 
institutes/institutions in the United Kingdom, Australia, France and the United 
States of America is foreseen.

Provisional research proposals

(I)     Research Institute for Nature Management (RIN)

1.      Comparative ecology of Pulmarine petrels in relation to phytology 
        and future management.

2.      Activity patterns, haul-out behavoir, densities and reproductive 
        biology of Weddell seals.

3.      Organochlorine and heavy metal residues in the Antarctic ecosystem.

(II)    Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)

1.      Silicate and aluminium dynamics near the sediment - water surface.

2.      Distribution of phytoplankton in relation to small-scale physical 
        processes in the water around Antarctica.
3. Recruitment of copepod populations in relation to the algal spring
bloom in Antarctic waters.

4. Respiratory activity and biomass of micro organisms.

(III) Institute of Meteorology and Oceanography (IMOU)

1. Computer-modelling of the Antarctic Icesheet, including participation
in glaciological expeditions.

(IV) Geological Survey of the Netherlands (RGD)

1. Petrographic investigations of surface sediments.
2. Distribution of siliceous, plankton and foraminifers.
3. Nannoplankton distribution.
4. Paleo-oceanography.

* The Netherlands will submit a more detailed programme as soon as possible via
diplomatic channels as is foreseen in the Antarctic Treaty.
