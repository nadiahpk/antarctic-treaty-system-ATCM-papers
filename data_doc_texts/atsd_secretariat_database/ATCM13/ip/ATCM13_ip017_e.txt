Item 7 of the agenda

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

(Information Paper submitted by the
United States)
Item 7 : Exchange of Information in Accordance with 
the Antarctic Treaty

(Information Paper submitted by the United States)

Recognizing the conflicting needs between timeliness and 
completeness of the exchange of information prescribed by 
paragraphs 3 and 4 of recommendation VIII-6, the United 
States has combined both reports into a single publication 
for each year since 1983.

The United States has found it convenient and efficient to 
compile both reports at the same time since many conditions 
reported as modifications at the end of the previous season 
are, de facto, the conditions existing for the next season's 
planned activities.  Completing both reports by 30 June each 
year is somewhat complicated by the fact that Austral acti-
vities begin earlier (in October) and terminate later (in 
May) than was the case when recommendation VIII-6 was adopted. 
Despite this difficulty, the United States believes that the 
essence of the planned program is accurately conveyed in 
terms of what, where, by whom, with what resources and appro-
ximately when the planned U.S. activities will take place.  
While minor technical details may be incomplete or inaccurate 
this would be true at any instant prior to completion of any 
activity, given the uncooperative nature of Antarctica and 
unpredictability of many expeditionary factors.  Such details 
changes can best be provided after the fact, in the report 
of modifications called for in paragraph 4 of recommendation 
VIII-6.

In a further attempt to improve the timeliness of this ex-
change of information, the United States has authorized its 
office responsible for the Antarctic program, the National 
Science Foundation, to transmit advance copies of this report 
directly to the cognizant offices of other nation's Antarctic 
programs.
2.

In response to the questions raised in paragraph 43 of the
report of the XIIth ATCM, the National Science Foundation
would like to receive the report of other nations' plans
before the end of September each year, and is clearly prepa-
red to transmit its own plans before the end of August each
year.  As noted above, the United States believes it desirable
to combine the reports of plans and modifications into a
single annual exchange of information, but considers all
items specified in paragraph 3 of the annex to recommendation
VIII-6 should be reported, to such extent as can be known or
"predicted" in the plans as of the date submitted.

The United States considers it impracticable to include summary
reports of scientific investigations in the annual exchange of
information, but considers the abstracts of proposed scienti-
fic investigations reported in the plans promotes a more
thorough and productive exchange within the International
Scientific Community.  At the same time, the United States
considers it important that summary reports of those planned
scientific activities are also exchanged within the Scientific
Community, and to this end the National Science Foundation
publishes these results in an annual review issue of the
Antarctic Journal of the United States.  The National Science
Foundation points out that this publication requires about
15 months to compile, edit and produce.
