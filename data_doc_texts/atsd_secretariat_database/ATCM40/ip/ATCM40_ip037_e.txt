Bird Monitoring in the Fildes Region

Information Paper submitted by Germany
Introduction
The Fildes region is characterized by a high biodiversity and accomodates six permanent research stations. Hence, the flora and fauna of this region have been subject of many scientific studies (e.g. Chupin, (1997), Krietsch et al. (2015), Lisovski et al. (2009), Mustafa et al. (2012), Peter et al. (1988), Peter et al. (2008), Peter et al. (2013), Pfeiffer (2005), Ritz et al. (2006), Soave et al. (2000)). German scientists have been carrying out a long-term monitoring of breeding birds in close cooperation with Korean and Russian scientists. Now, their recent report has been published (Braun et al. 2017). 
Abstract 
The Fildes Region (King George Island, South Shetland Islands), consisting of the Fildes Peninsula, the neighbouring Ardley Island and all larger, nearby islands, is one of the largest ice-free regions in maritime Antarctic and has a relatively high level of biodiversity. This area is characterised by scientific and tourism activities and also represents the logistical centre of the Antarctic Peninsula with its six permanent stations, numerous field huts and an airstrip, that often leads to spatial and temporal overlaps of the various interests. Given the great importance of long-term monitoring programmes, especially in regions with natural resources at high risk and in areas of rapid climatic change, the survey of local breeding birds communities started in the 1980s in the Fildes Region and was continued in the summer months (December to February) of the 2012/2013 to 2014/2015 seasons. In addition, a monitoring of breeding birds took place in all large ice-free areas of the Maxwell Bay, which borders the Fildes Region. These included the Barton, Weaver and Potter Peninsula, Green Point (all on King George Island) and for the Stansbury Peninsula, Martin and Duthoit Points (all on Nelson Island). To analyse long-term trends in the bird populations, extensive data from numerous, still unpublished expedition reports of German scientists from the 1980s and all available literature were added to recent observations. 
The database collected over 35 years reveals detailed conclusions about the development of local populations of the three penguin species (Adélie, gentoo and chinstrap). For example, the results of breeding pair recordings from the 2012/2013 to 2014/2015 seasons confirm the long-term population trends of this mixed colony for all three species. According to this, the number of breeding pairs of the chinstrap penguin has shrunk by over 90 % since the start of data collection in 1979/1980. After an evident drop in the 1980s and 1990s, the number of breeding pairs has remained stable since the 2004/2005 season, although at a very low level. It even recently showed an upturn from its minimum of 8 breeding pairs in the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 seasons to 16 breeding pairs in the 2014/2015 season. A similar development was seen in the population of Adélie penguins on Ardley Island, whose numbers declined by over 30 % in the past 35 years. The 1980s and 1990s were characterised by strong annual fluctuations, reaching a peak of 1953 breeding pairs in the 1987/1988 season, but then decreasing strongly from the beginning of the 2000s. Since the 2003/2004 season, the number of Adélie penguins has also stabilised, and 512 breeding pairs were counted in the 2014/2015 season. The latest declines were associated with unfavourable weather conditions like snowy springs with a late snowmelt (2007/2008, 2009/2010 and 2013/2014 seasons) and severe precipitation at the beginning of the breeding period (2014/2015 season). In contrast to gentoo penguins, which demonstrate greater flexibility in their breeding phenology, Adélie penguins appear to find it difficult to evade adverse conditions in spatial or temporal terms. On the other hand, while the number of gentoo penguins showed steep drops in the early 1980s and in the second half of the 1990s, the total population increased by over 80 % and reached its highest level since continuous monitoring started with 6,475 breeding pairs in the 2014/2015 season. Correspondingly, there was a clear negative correlation between the number of breeding pairs of Adélie penguins and that of the gentoo penguins, which stresses the strong divergence in the population development of these two species. Nevertheless, there was no statistical connection in the annual rate of change in the number of breeding pairs of the two species, calculated according to Carlini et al. (2009), i.e. the populations of the two species changed each year neither simultaneously nor inversely. This suggests that the Adélie and gentoo penguins of this colony respond differently to the natural environmental factors like the availability of food or local snow and weather conditions or to human disturbance. The documented development of the number of breeding pairs of the three penguin species matches the frequently published long-term trends of the western Antarctic Peninsula. These causes are suspected to lie in complex ecological processes due to the progressing global warming and the concomitant regional decrease in the winter sea ice extent.
The breeding success (number of chicks per breeding pair) of the three penguin species nesting on Ardley Island showed distinct variations. The breeding success of the few chinstrap penguin breeding pairs still resident in these colonies remained consistently above the long-term average of 1.18 chicks per breeding pair in the past 8 years, but given the substantial fluctuations, especially in the 1990s, and a total loss of young in the 2003/2004 season, no statistically significant trend is evident. 
Adélie penguins on Ardley Island have a long-term average of 1.16 chicks per breeding pair, but the breeding success has fluctuated wildly and decreased significantly between the 1981/1982 and 2014/2015 seasons. As the breeding success level of Adélie penguins on Ardley Island is comparable or even higher than that of other colonies, the decline of Adélie penguins on Ardley Island does not seem to be due to a persistently low breeding success. It is assumed that other factors contribute significantly to the observed general decline in Adélie penguins, such as high winter mortality, especially among the offspring, and low recruitment rates. The breeding success of gentoo penguins on Ardley Island demonstrates clearly fewer fluctuations over the years compared to the other two penguin species nesting there and was much higher than their breeding success with a long-term average of 1.30 chicks per breeding pair. This value is also high in comparison with other gentoo penguin colonies. Examined over the entire study period, however, the breeding success of gentoo penguins on Ardley Island decreased significantly. The proven inverse development of an evident population growth among gentoo penguins on Ardley Island with concurrent decline in their breeding success suggests that the number of surviving and recruited young birds returning to the colonies is apparently sufficient together with any immigrating individuals to ensure persistent population growth. Sharp declines in the breeding success of both Adélie penguins and gentoo penguins on Ardley Island were recorded predominantly in seasons with a snowy spring and late start of the snowmelt (2007/2008, 2009/2010 and 2012/2013 seasons) and in association with heavy snowfalls during the breeding phase (2014/2015 season). Chinstrap penguins were not or less obviously affected, as the few breeding pairs of this species nest on small, rocky heights, where snow does not readily accumulate.
The southern giant petrel is a highly susceptible species and thus carries a high risk for negative effects due to the concentration of human activities in the Fildes Region. In the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons, a total of 266 or 290 occupied southern giant petrels nests or breeding pairs, respectively, was recorded in the Fildes Region. In contrast, the recorded number of breeding pairs of 425 for the 2014/2015 season clearly exceeded the long-term average of 303 breeding pairs and represents the highest value since the beginning of measurements. In long-term comparisons, the population of southern giant petrel in the Fildes Region has been stable for years despite large inter-annual fluctuations. When focussing on individual parts of the colony, very different developments can be noticed. While steady growth was seen in the northernmost colony in the Fildes Region, which is visited less often by scientists and rarely by visitors due to its relatively great distance from the stations, the number of breeding pairs in a southern colony declined at the same time. A possible cause of this discrepancy could be the repeated disturbance caused by visitors of the field hut located there. A decrease in the number of breeding pairs was also observed in the southernmost colony on Dart Island. The observed changes in the number of breeding pairs in different regions are likely not due to natural environmental factors, as neighbouring colonies subject to the same natural conditions (e.g. availability of food, predation, snow levels) demonstrate a different population development. Anthropogenic disturbance appears to have such an effect that a decline in the number of breeding pairs is only observed in colonies that are often visited in the summer months. Neighbouring colonies that are rarely or not at all visited have either a stable number of breeding pairs or show a population increase. The latter aspect suggests that repeated shifting of the nesting sites is due to anthropogenic influences. It is difficult to estimate how much areas bordering the Fildes Region (Barton & Potter Peninsula, Duthoit Point and Stansbury Peninsula on Nelson Island, Nelson Island) are similarly affected by the nesting site shifting as there are not enough data available yet. Another interesting point is the increasing number of nesting attempts in numerous abandoned breeding sites in the Fildes Region over the past ten years, which are partially affected by a high level of human activities. This suggests a possible habituation to regular and predictable disturbance. In the recolonised regions, however, hardly any chicks have been successfully raised to maturity. As the breeding success of southern giant petrels can be considered a suitable indicator of human disturbance, great attention is again being paid to recording this parameter. In the 2012/2013 to 2014/2015 seasons the breeding success was below the long-term average of 0.36 chicks per breeding pair. The adverse environmental conditions probably played a large role in this as all colonies in the Fildes Region were equally affected. 
The number of breeding pairs of the cape petrel sank continuously over the study period and was only 10 % of the average population in the 1980s with 39 breeding pairs in the 2014/2015 season. There is no obvious cause as direct anthropogenic disturbance affects only a couple of breeding sites with relatively few breeding pairs.
The results of the continued recording of populations of brown skua and south polar skuas and of mixed pairs showed a strong rise in the number of breeding pairs of south polar skuas in the 2000s, followed by a dramatic decline in the past three seasons. In contrast, the population of brown skuas and the mixed pairs have remained stable in the past decades. There has been a significant increase in the number of territories colonised by skuas returning from their overwintering regions (data analysed for 2007/08 to 2014/15). Whether these pairs start breeding depends on the prevailing environmental conditions. In the past three seasons 174, 178 and 188 territories, respectively, were colonised by south polar skuas. On the other hand, there were 12 pairs in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons and 30 pairs in the 2014/2015 season that actually started breeding. The number of brown skuas occupying a territory in the same time period but not breeding was much smaller. This suggests that the two species respond differently to local environmental factors. This is supported by the fact that south polar skuas raised young successfully only in six of the past eight seasons, while the breeding success of brown skuas generally remained stable despite a negative tendency. It is likely that the limited number of breeding pairs and the lack of breeding success of south polar skuas in the recent past are primarily due to the poor availability of food in the marine-pelagic region as the two skua species breed sympatrically, and they are distinguished by their feeding ecology. In addition, predation by skuas, both inter- and intraspecific, has apparently contributed significantly to the reduction in breeding success. This applies especially to regions with a high density of skuas, as in the Fildes Region. The predation risk rises further with extended search flights for food due to a lack of food.
In summary, it could be shown, that regarding their breeding pair numbers most seabird species depend primarily on environmental factors, whereas others are more affected by anthropogenic impacts. 
Concluding remarks
Seabirds are good indicators for the state of (marine) ecosystems and carrying out such long-term monitoring creates very valuable data sets about changes of local population sizes. Even if not all drivers and mechanisms are understood so far, these data are a useful basis for further analysis regarding environmental factors influencing these population changes.
