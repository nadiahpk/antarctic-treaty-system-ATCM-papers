Search and Rescue Coordination and Response in the Antarctic:
Report from the COMNAP Antarctic SAR Workshop III
Workshop co-hosted by the Chilean Directorate General of the
Maritime
Territory and Merchant Marine (DIRECTEMAR)
& the Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH)
Background
Under international maritime and aeronautical agreements, the
Rescue Coordination Centres (RCCs) of five countries (Argentina,
Australia, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa) share responsibility
for the coordination of Search and Rescue (SAR) over the Antarctic
Treaty region. A description of SAR arrangements and systems in
place was provided by COMNAP to ATCM XXXI (2008) in IP099
Search and Rescue in the Antarctic.
The RCCs rely on the cooperation of National Antarctic Programs
and others in an Antarctic SAR situation and there are a range of
informal and formal agreements in place to facilitate these
activities.
Based on the success of two workshops on improving SAR
coordination and response that COMNAP convened in Viña del
Mar/Valparaiso, Chile, in August 2008 (see ATCM XXXII (2009)
WP047) and in Bueños, Aires, Argentina, in November 2009 (see
ATCM XXXIII (2010) IP076) and in accordance with ATCM XXXVI
Resolution 4 (2013), SAR Workshop III was convened and held on
1–2 June 2016, Valparaiso, Chile.
The Final Report from SAR Workshop III, as agreed by all
participants at that workshop, is provided as an attachment to this
Information Paper. Presentations made at the workshop are
available (as PDFs) from the Publications/Symposiums & Workshop
Reports page of the COMNAP website.
Planning Underway for Next SAR Workshop COMNAP has
preliminary indication from Antarctica New Zealand that they will
be in a position to co-host, with assistance from Maritime New
Zealand/RCCNZ, the SAR Workshop IV in 2019 in New Zealand.
Details and dates to be confirmed.
