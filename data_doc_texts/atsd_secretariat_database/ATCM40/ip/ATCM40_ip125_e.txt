Report on the 19th edition of the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol between 
Argentina and Chile (PANC)
Background
The Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol (PANC) has its origin in 1998, when Chile and Argentina determined the need to coordinate their efforts in the Antarctic SAR areas of responsibility of both Parties, established in the “International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue” of 1979 (SAR Convention), which also requires cooperation and coordination among neighbor States.
Since its creation, the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol has performed its activities within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). For this reason Chile and Argentina include the participating vessels in their respective pre-season information, notifying other Parties of its configuration.
Likewise, both Parties have permanently informed the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings about the PANC’s activities through Information Papers (IP), providing details on support and rescues carried out each season. These reports can be found in IP 26 ATCM XXVI; IP 121 ATCM XXXIV; IP 109 ATCM XXXVI; IP 99 ATCM XXXVII and IP 109 ATCM XXXIX, among others.

Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol 2016/2017

During the last Antarctic season, Argentina and Chile, through their Maritime Rescue Coordinator Centers, the Southern Naval Area Command in Ushuaia, and the Chief Command of the Third Naval Zone in Punta Arenas, carried out the nineteenth (19th) edition of the PANC, which took place between 15 November 2016 and 31 March 2017. The PANC performed search, rescue, salvage, pollution control activities and exercises, with the aim of providing safety to navigation, to human life at sea, and contributing to maintaining waters free from pollution in the area situated south of parallel 60°S and between the meridians 10°W and 131°W.
During the aforementioned period there was always an Antarctic Service Vessel (BSA) present in the joint Antarctic SAR area of responsibility, which has maritime rescue capability and is equipped to fight pollution. There was also another vessel available, with similar capabilities, identified as Antarctic Support Vessel (BAA), which stayed in its base port to support the first one in case of necessity.
Timeframes of the latest PANC were the following:
    • ALFA, between November 15 and December 18 of 2016: CHILE, ATF “Lautaro”.
    • BRAVO, between December 19, 2016 and January 22, 2017: ARGENTINA, ARA “Islas Malvinas”.
    • CHARLIE, between January 23 and February 26 of 2017: CHILE, ATF “Lautaro”.
    • DELTA, between February 27 and March 31, 2017: ARGENTINA ARA “Islas Malvinas”.
Additional to the main mission of the PANC, the Antarctic Service Vessel performs the following activities, which are carried out provided that they do not interfere with the main purpose of the Patrol:
    • Assistance to navigation: Meteorological support to vessels and ships that navigate in the area of the patrol. As a mobile weather station, it contributes with data for the elaboration of the area weather forecast through the meteorological services of both countries. 
    • Maritime aid to navigation of both countries within the PANC area.
    • Medical Assistance: the units that form the PANC have the capability to provide low complexity level medical support. To do so, they have a doctor on board, with the aim of assisting in emergency situations.
    • Support to the Antarctic scientific community: Through the transportation of personnel and/or scientific equipment between bases or stations.
    • Logistics: Through replenishment tasks for bases and stations of both countries and of other Treaty members.
The result of this joint effort during the 19th edition of the PANC was the following:
    • Total miles navigated: 15.916,8 NM. (29.477,9 Km)
    • Time at sea: 161.8 days.
    • Total assistance provided to vessels: none.
    • Maritime traffic: Radio contact for the support of safety of navigation and weather assistance was made with 228 vessels of different flags in the SAR area.
    • Exchange visits and logistic support activities were performed with a total of 25 bases from 11 different nationalities (Argentina, Germany, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Ecuador, Spain, United States, Poland and United Kingdom).
    • Pollution monitoring took place in three areas (ARA “Bahía Paraíso” shipwreck 1989, M/V “Explorer” shipwreck 2007, and “Kai-Xin” sinking 2013), verifying the lack of spills or any other event that could affect the Antarctic environment.
This shared effort by Argentina and Chile allows the carrying out of the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol and contributes to the rational use of the resources of both countries. 

Contributions to the PANC
The Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol has safeguarded human life at sea, contributed to the safety of navigation, and has fought environmental pollution in an area of sustained growth of maritime activities (tour cruises, scientific activities, non-governmental vessels, logistic vessels, fishing vessels, etc.) in the area of the Antarctic Peninsula. 
Given the presence in this SAR responsibility area, assigned by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to Chile and Argentina,  the PANC  permits decreased reaction times in case of an emergency in the Antarctic continent and its adjacent waters, and provides  prompt response in case of an event that threatens the Antarctic environment. The organization and continuous practice of this patrol has also allowed immediate and effective SAR activities in the area of operations.
At the same time, it has strengthened the mutual trust and friendship among both countries, providing permanent support to the scientific community, national programs and tour operators.
