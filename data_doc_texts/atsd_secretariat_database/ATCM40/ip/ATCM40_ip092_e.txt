Turkey-Chile Scientific Collaboration in Antarctica

Summary

On the context of the First Turkish Scientific Expedition to Antarctica; collaboration with the Chilean Antarctic Institute is reported.


 Turkey - Chile Scientific Collaboration

Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), conducted over ninety academic projects during the 2016 - 2017 Antarctic season and offered a variety of cooperation and collaborations opportunities for foreign institutes and scientists. Accordingly, the INACH announced its projects through its official websites and during international meetings and forums regarding Antarctic science.

	Within the international cooperation opportunities offered by INACH, a cooperation scheme was developed with the Istanbul Technical University Polar Research Center (PolReC) for the 2016-2017 Antarctic season. Asst. Prof. Dr. Olgun Nazlı Kıyak from Istanbul Technical University Eurasia Institute of Earth Sciences was chosen for one of the scientific projects led by INACH. Within the leadership of Dr. Maria Soledad Astorga, Asst. Prof. Dr. Kıyak conducted research on “Characterization of methane cycling in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lakes” at Prof. Escudero Base between February 12 and March 7 of 2017, during the 53rd Chilean Scientific Antarctic Expedition.

	Asst. Prof. Dr. Kıyak’s research with the support of INACH was successfully conducted and completed. Therefore, we would like to thank to the INACH and Chilean authorities for their support and kind hospitality. We do believe in that such cooperation may be of interest to Non-Consultative Parties that do not maintain Antarctic bases but strive to conduct “substantial scientific research activity” for the attainment of Consultative Status.
