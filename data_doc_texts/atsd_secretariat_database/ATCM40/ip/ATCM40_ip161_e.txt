What does the United Nations Paris Climate Agreement mean for Antarctica?
Information Paper submitted by SCAR

Summary

The SCAR Science presentation to XL ATCM will outline the implications of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement1 for Antarctica. Key issues addressed are:

    • The relationship between the ATS, its agreements and SCAR and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

    • The consequences for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean of 1.5°C, 2°C, and more than 2°C of global warming are presented based on the latest international science, much of which has been conducted under the auspices of SCAR’s strategic research programmes2. 

    • The poorly understood, and potentially underestimated, contribution of Antarctic ice loss to future global sea-level rise (SLR) is a major uncertainty in policy-relevant climate science. This was highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report in 20133. Advances in understanding since 2013 will be presented in the context of future climate pathways where 2°C of global warming is achieved, or alternatively, not achieved.

    • Understanding the impacts and avoided impacts of achieving the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, for ATS members, their activities, and implications for the rest of the world is a key Future Science Challenge identified by SCAR4,5 and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP)6 addressed in ACTM XL Working Group 2 agenda item 15a (see Background Paper 20).


The Paris Climate Agreement

    • The Paris climate Agreement was signed by 196 member nations of the UNFCCC at the 21st meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 21) in December 2015. 

    • The UNFCCC is an international environmental treaty negotiated at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with the objective to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".

    • The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2°C - “the safe guardrail for dangerous climate change” identified by the IPCC, and introduced by the UNFCCC at Copenhagen in 2009. 

    • This will be achieved through nationally determined commitments (NDCs) aimed to reduce all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero before the end of this century. 

    • Following pressure from vulnerable African and low-lying coastal nations, the parties further agreed to “pursue efforts to” limit temperature increase to 1.5°C.

    • The Paris Climate Agreement was subsequently signed by 194 countries in New York on Earth Day, 22nd April 2016, and the Agreement went into force on 7th November 2016. 

    • The Paris Agreement is challenging, especially given, that at the current rate of global emissions ~40Gt per year, Earth’s surface temperature could reach an increase of 2°C in the next 15 years. 

    • The NDCs tabled in Paris, if implemented, will restrict global warming to ~2.7°C. This is still above the UNFCCC safe guardrail and well-above the more ambitious goal of 1.5°C. Moreover, an assessment of current policy settings sees global temperatures stabilizing closer to 3.5°C. 

    • To be on track to meet the Paris target, all parties need to commit to 40% reduction in global GHG emissions with respect to 1990 levels, by 2030. This is the EU commitment, but many nations NDCs fall well short of this. The Agreement requires parties to increase their commitments during 5-yearly global stock takes, to achieve the target. 


The relevance of the UNFCCC and IPCC to the ATS.

    • The ATS, charged with the governance of the world’s 5th largest continent, has no status within the UNFCCC.

    • Less than one third of the 194 member states of the UNFCCC belong to ATS and have direct access to Antarctica for research, yet the UNFCCC, through the IPCC process, requires that scientific knowledge. 

    • SCAR has observer status within the IPCC, via its membership of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). 

    • SCAR/ICSU nominates participants to attend IPCC meetings, as well as candidates to be considered for authorship of special reports and assessment reports. 

    • More importantly SCAR helps mobilise the international science community to address the impact of climate change on Antarctica, and the role Antarctica plays in the global climate system. 

    • Two of SCAR’s strategic research programmes, Past Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics (PAIS) and Antarctic Climate in the 21st Century (AntClim21) made significant contributions to the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report from the legacy of several large International Polar Year research initiatives, and are positioning themselves to make even more significant contributions to 6th Assessment Report. 

    • Critical knowledge gaps and research priorities have been identified through strategic assessments carried out by national Antarctic programs and funding agencieseg. 7 and by the SCAR Horizon Scan process held in New Zealand in 20144,5. These are of direct relevance and interest to the IPCC as it prepares for its 6th integrated assessment report and two newly commissioned Special Reports - “Global Warming at 1.5°C” and “Climate change and the oceans and the cryosphere”. 

    • The ATS and its agreements (e.g. the Protocol on Environmental Protection and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) also require evidence-based policy and decision-making, that includes knowledge of the impacts of climate change. 

    • To meet these challenges the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) has undertaken the Antarctic Road Map Challenge (ARC), which identifies the resources, infrastructure, logistics and supporting technologies needed to enable priority science objectives to be achieved over the coming decades6.
