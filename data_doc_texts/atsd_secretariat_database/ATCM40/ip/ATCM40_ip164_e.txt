Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2016-2017 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines use. This information paper presents the data collected by IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the 2016-2017 season. No non-IAATO visits are included in this analysis.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found in ATCM XL IPxx IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2016/17 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2017/18 and on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).
Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.  
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all traditional commercial ship-borne tourism with landings to the Peninsula during the 2016-17 season was conducted by IAATO Operators, it is believed that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity.

Comparing the 2016-17 season with the peak season of 2007-2008, the following trends are visible:
    • Since 2011-2012 there has been a recovery in the number of passengers taking part in traditional ship borne tourism to the Peninsula following the global recession in 2008. This growth has been variable, however the total number of passengers from ships making landings in the Antarctic Peninsula in 2016-17 (35,537) has now surpassed the 2007-08 peak (31,352).  In part this is due to new vessels being operated with higher passenger capacity and also due to the increased number of voyages (see below). 

    • Following the steady decline in IAATO ships operating in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to only 20 in the 2011-12 season, there has been a resurgence with 28 SOLAS passenger vessels making landings in the Peninsula in the 2016-17 season. Notably, many of the new ships entering the market – in both the IAATO Category 1 (13-200 passenger) and Category 2 (201-500 passenger) brackets, are operated at near to maximum number of clients for each category (e.g. Le Soleal and Le Lyrial with 200 clients and Seabourn Quest and Midnatsol operating with 450+ clients).   
    • There has been an increase in the number of voyages (from 225 in 2014-15, to 236 in 2015-16, and now reaching 253 during the 2016-17 season) .The previous peak in 2007/08 totalled 247 voyages. This is reflective  of a move towards more  air/cruise tourism which negates the need for four to five days per voyage outside Antarctic Treaty waters to facilitate passenger turnarounds in Antarctica and accounts for the increase in the number of passengers, and the increase in the number of vessels. 
    • There was a 10% increase in the number of landings made from last season (2206 to 2427), this is lower than expected when considering the increase in voyages, however reflective of the increase in Category 2 vessels which may only be able to make one landing per day.
There was a decrease in the number of landing sites used (125 to 111). This is believed to be due to the heavy ice conditions encountered south of the Lemaire Channel for the entirity of the 2016/17 season.

Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Table 1 illustrates the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made for the 2016-17 season. 
The top five sites (Cuverville Island, Whalers Bay, Goudier Island, Halfmoon Island and Neko Harbour) accounted for 35% of all tourists landed and 28% of landings made during the season. The top twenty most visited sites accounted for circa 64% of the landings, with the top twenty five landing sites accounting for just over 70% of the landings. 
These relatively high percentages of activity at a small number of sites continue to indicate that the trend of landings concentrating at a few popular sites remains strong. See also ATCM XXXIX IP 104 Patterns of Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Region: A 20-year analysis.
All of these most-visited sites are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or National Program management through their proximity to stations. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula in the 2016-17 season. Landings took place in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 1 November 2016 – 1 April 2017 (a total of 151 days). This is considerably less than the peak of 174 days in the 2007/08 season. (The extended season in 2007/08 was largely due to the operation of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov making early season visits to emperor penguin colonies.) As in previous years there is a natural variation throughout the season in levels of activity; for example in the peak season the greatest number of landings made on any one day (31 December) was 35, while the lowest number in the same period was 11 landings (16 January). 
The core period for visitation by ships was 90 days between early December to early March. Despite the increase in activites, on the basis of the full season dates only two sites (Cuverville  Island and Whaler’s Bay), received an average of more than one visit per day throughout the season, with an additional three sites (Neko Harbour, Goudier Island and Half Moon Island) receiving an average of more than one visit per day during the core season.
Additional tourism statistics will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).

Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and an analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.  Appendix 3 illustrates the total number of known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met. 

Co-ordination among IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily limits set in the site guidelines were honoured during the 2016-17 season. 
Conclusion
The information extracted from the ATCM Post Visit Reports shows that overall tourism levels have increased from the peak season of 2007-08, and, as highlighted in ATCM XL IPxx IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2016/17 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2017/18  are likely to exceed these numbers during the 2017/18 season. The increase is not uniform however, with a few sites absorbing the majority of the increase, and others seeing a decrease in activity. The pattern of concentrated increase is believed to be explained in part by the popularity of these sites due to their reliability of access and ease of visitor management at these sites but also the entry into the market of larger capacity vessels, and the increase in air/cruise tourism. 
All the landing sites in the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Program Management guidelines. 
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
