Introduction:

The International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code) was created as a complement to other existing conventions, with the aim of increasing the safety of the ships’ operations and reducing their impacts on people and the environment in polar waters, which are considered remote, vulnerable and inhospitable. The Antarctic and Maritime Polar Climate present from the south of the Magellan Strait, Drake Passage and Antarctic Peninsula possess a real challenge for crew, since the harshness of the climate shows all its cruelty, with very low temperatures even in summer, bays completely covered by ice, uncountable and dangerous drifting icebergs (some of them undetectable until they are only a few meters away), while weather conditions change very rapidly and frontal systems cross with unusual violence. 

During the V International Workshop of Port Meteorological Officers (P.M.O.), held in Viña del Mar in July 2015, with the participation of professionals from 24 countries, the Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) expressed that this scientific-technical community is especially interested in being able to verify the results of the numerical forecast models and complement the satellite observations, contrasting them with in situ data of drifting buoys, ocean profilers, and research cruises in the vast South Pacific Ocean and, above all, in the Antarctic Peninsula. In fact, near our coasts there are only a few daily reports, from research vessels, transoceanic ships, logistic vessels, and passenger ships (recruited by the Meteorological Services of Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States).

An example of the previous was the recent incorporation of the Chilean Navy Training Ship ESMERALDA and the Chilean Navy Oceanographic Ship CABO DE HORNOS to the mobile voluntary stations fleet of the World Meteorological Organization, by sending regular reports during their navigations in high seas, while both units carry out their respective Training Cruises and research activities. Because of this, they have received the recognition and the assistance of the Port Meteorological Officers (P.M.O.)

The global monitoring of the El Niño phenomenon and the sustained increase of the frequency of heavy seas, including those considered as "abnormal", pose the concrete need of a greater interaction among related organisms; which require the exchange of information in real time, committing the international support and the continuity of studies related to environmental conditions.

Meteorological Support




Each year, usually from November to April, the Chilean Navy carries out the Antarctic Campaign operating with at least four vessels (Icebreaker "VIEL", Transportation vessel "AQUILES", Patrol vessel "FUENTEALBA", and Ocean Tug “LAUTARO”). For this purpose, the Meteorological Service of the Navy, Armada http://meteoarmada.directemar.cl, assesses climatological information, the experiences of previous years, analysis of synoptic surface charts, coastal stations reports, as well as information from satellite images and numerical modeling for weather prediction, in order to assist with the conditions expected in high seas and the coast, including the  coverage of marine ice concentration and limits. 

The analysis and forecast of these phenomena for the vessels in the area is provided by the Maritime Meteorological Center of the Maritime Governor’s Office of Punta Arenas.

For the daily analysis of local forecasts, it is essential to have information about the geographical and oceanographical features of each place, the navigation route, tidal regime, light and dark hours, surface charts drawing, reception of graphic information via radiofax (radiofacsimile), weather data recorded on board and on shore, as well as the general support provided by Punta Arenas and the information that can be obtained quickly from official Internet pages (CPTEC, DMC, SMN ARG, BOM, ENVISAT, NASA MODIS and GOES, NOAA: ARL, MRF-GFS, NCEP and WW3). 

In the process of  obtaining the images and graphic reports from the Internet, satellite pictures for the Antarctic area take approximately 55 seconds to download and the animation of a wave model for the ocean can take up to 30 minutes (according to the quality of each connection). To optimize navigation times, the Meteorological Service of the Navy designed a light version of its own page http://web.directemar.cl/met/jturno/indice/index.htm, which also includes the most frequently used direct links for the predictive models (national and foreign), satellite images of cloud cover and ice distribution, meteograms, web cams, marine weather forecasts, and data from automatic and auxiliary weather stations http://web.directemar.cl/met/jturno/indice/calendario.htm.   

Also, Chile, through the Maritime Meteorological Center of Punta Arenas, incorporated the monitoring of drifting icebergs in Antarctic waters, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula, Bransfield Strait, South Shetland Islands, Anvers Island, Adelaide Island, and Marguerite Bay, shown in http://web.directemar.cl/met/jturno/cartas/hielo.jpg

Climatology:

Chile, through observations at its Antarctic Bases and Weather Stations in the Antarctica, has a record of the environmental conditions. Some of them send a report every three hours to the member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), generating large series of data managed by the Chilean Meteorological Directorate (DMC), which allow to characterize the Polar Climate, the maritime influence of the Antarctic Peninsula and its inter-annual variability, as well as Climate Change and the effects of the Global Warming.

The Meteorological Service of the Navy has developed new graphic and computer products, like the sectorized charts of Antarctic marine ice, maritime weather local forecasts, automatic monitoring and wind and waves prediction. It has also prepared, climate statistics to adopt rules of design and operation of vessels, especially after the international adoption and entry into force of the Polar Code, which includes among its “definitions” the “Mean Daily Low Temperatures (MDLT)”, that is the mean value of the daily low temperature for each day of the year over a minimum 10 year period”. It also indicates that “A data set acceptable to the administration may be used if 10 years of data is not available”.  

The MDLT determined by the Administration is an important data that defines the “Polar Service Temperature (PST)” for a vessel (set 10ºC below the lowest MDLT), determining if that vessel could operate at “Low Air Temperatures (LAT)” with temperatures below -10ºC, being registered in the Polar Ship Certificate.

The National Maritime Administration selected, through the Meteorological Service of the Chilean Navy (SMA), the longest and most complete series between the available climate data statistic (45, 50 and 63 years), corresponding to the Meteorological Stations of the three first Chilean Antarctic Bases.



Validity Area: 

According to the location of the bases and stations, data is representative of the area of the regular operations of most vessels that currently visit the Antarctica, defined between the Drake Passage and the Bransfield Strait; from Latitude 60º South and Longitude 53º West up to Latitude 65ºS and Longitude 65ºW (South Shetland archipelago to the Argentine Islands). The Wedell Sea is excluded due to its different continental glaciological configuration.

Conclusion:

Please take note of the information provided in this document that Chile makes available for the community of the Antarctic Treaty, and distribute it to the vessels that hoist the flag of each Member country, with the aim of safeguarding the human life in the Antarctic area and help in the prevention of maritime incidents that could cause pollution of the marine environment.
