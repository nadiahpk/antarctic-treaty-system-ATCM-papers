Advances to the COMNAP database

COMNAP often requests information from its Member national Antarctic programs and has introduced procedures for exchange of information in order to support the work of COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs in regards to international co-operation in science, science support, operations, logistics and in Search and Rescue (SAR) situations to name only a few examples.
There are also information exchange requirements which are an obligation on Antarctic Treaty Parties in Articles III and VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty, in several articles of the Environmental Protocol and in a number of Recommendations, Measures, and Resolutions as adopted by the Parties.
Providing information in relation to the capabilities of national Antarctic program is a significant responsibility, and one that all programs take very seriously.  It is also an obligation that places a burden on already busy national Antarctic program staff, who must provide the information into multiple databases and systems and must ensure that the provision of data into each is done in a timely manner that addresses the need for currency in the data.
The task is often complicated and time-consuming, since many of the databases ask for the same data to be input across multiple organisations, and some of the databases require specific expertise in order to contribute to them.  For example, the air operations database in support of the COMNAP Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) requires that someone with in-depth knowledge of aviation infrastructures and operations be responsible for understanding AFIM data requirements and for providing the relevant data.
There is potential for duplication of some of the information that is being exchanged in the different databases and systems across the range of Antarctic organisations.  This creates duplication of efforts, ultimately more work for those entering the data into multiple systems and creates a risk that some important information is not being directed to where it will be of most benefit or at a time when it would be of most critical use.  Especially in SAR situations, information should be readily available, reliable and current.
COMNAP recently underwent a complete redevelopment of its database system in order to advance work on the AFIM and in support of the COMNAP Infrastructure Catalogue project (see COMNAP IP for further information on this project). 
As a result of this redevelopment, the COMNAP database is now a fairly complete and up-to-date source of information on COMNAP Member national Antarctic program infrastructures and vessels. 
The COMNAP database was developed as a source of information for use by Member national Antarctic programs.  However, advances in technology coupled with good planning in development mean that information exchange into duplicate fields in separate databases (such as the EIES) is now possible.

COMNAP developed the database via the US Polar Geospatial Center with the support and leadership of the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs, and with input from all COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs.
