Final Modernization of GONDWANA Station, Terra Nova Bay, northern Victoria Land

The German Gondwana Station is a non-permanent facility at Gerlache Inlet of Terra Nova Bay on the Ross Sea, operated by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR). It was erected during the GANOVEX III expedition in 1982/1983 as a bivouac hut and then extended and converted into a summer station during GANOVEX V (1988/1989). The main building consists of 16 interconnected 20-foot containers. Gondwana Station is accessible by ship or an aeroplane capable of landing on the sea ice in Terra Nova Bay. Gondwana Station was used as the main base during numerous BGR expeditions to northern Victoria Land.

In IP30 presented at ATCM XXXIX in Santiago, Chile, in 2016, Germany informed the Parties about major renovation and modernization of the station carried out in the 2015-16 Antarctic season. The operation was based on an Initial Environmental Study (IES) that was submitted to the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) in April 2015. Based on an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE), UBA issued a permit in November 2015 under a condition and several provisos. 

In October and November 2016, the renovation and modernization of Gondwana Station was finalized and the construction work was accepted by the responsible authorities. The station is now ready for future operation for at least 25-30 years as a base for scientific research in northern Victoria Land.

Transport of material and personnel was accomplished with the logistic support of the Italian National Antarctic Research Programme. Germany very much acknowledges the support of the neighbouring stations Jang Bogo and Mario Zucchelli of the Korean and Italian National Antarctic Programmes.
