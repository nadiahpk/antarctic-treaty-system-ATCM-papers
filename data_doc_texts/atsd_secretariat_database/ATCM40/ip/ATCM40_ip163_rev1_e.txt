IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2016-17 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 
2017-18 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide estimates of Antarctic tourism from IAATO Operators for the 2017-18 season and the statistical data compiled from Post Visit Reports for the 2016-17 season.
These figures are based on information provided to IAATO by its Operators as of April 18, 2017. These numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO Operator companies and do not include those individuals taking part in research projects that are being supported by IAATO Operators. However, these numbers do include data from seven Operators who are applying to join IAATO at the IAATO 2017 Annual Meeting (due to take place 2-4 May, 2017). 
Preliminary numbers indicate that the 2016-17 season (44,367 persons) was slightly higher (by 500 visitors) than the forecast in ATCM XXXIX IP112 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2015-16 and Preliminary Estimates for 2016-17 Season. Estimates for 2017-18 indicate that passenger numbers will rise to approximately 46,385 individuals. 
1.0	Overview
This section focuses on the 2016-17 season and additional information on previous seasons, including activities and landing site use, will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Guidelines and Resources, Tourism Statistics. Additionally, selected site-specific information is available in ATCM XL IP164 Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2016-17 Season.
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area are currently members of IAATO, with one exception - a Japanese flagged non-IAATO cruise-only vessel, OCEAN DREAM that cruised the Antarctic Peninsula in January 2017. All of IAATO Operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

Final analysis of Post Visit Reports for the 2016-17 season indicates that there was a 15% increase in the overall tourism statistics from the 2015-16 season. Shipborne tourism remains dominant on the Peninsula and there were no IAATO Operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent. 

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities by IAATO Operators included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, submersible diving, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), running events, helicopter operations, underwater ROVs and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  These activities were undertaken in line with IAATO policies and guidelines. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s.

	** Includes IAATO and non-IAATO member-operated yachts (sailing and motor) where the information was available.
	*** Based on pre-season estimates not actual statistics  

The vast majority of tourism voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November to March), departing from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Antarctic Treaty Area. 
1.3	Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more than 100 different nationalities were represented by tourists who visited the Antarctic during the 2016-17 season.

1.4	Commercial Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts
Detailed information of the activities conducted during the 2016-17 season are listed in Appendix 2, and anticipated activities for the 2017-18 season can be found in Appendix 3. All IAATO Operators activities are permitted or authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, submitted in advance of the season. All activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and nearly all activities have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 
1.5	Commercial Deep Field Tourism 
Four IAATO Operators conducted deep field tourism activities during the 2016-17 season: 
    • Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – (originally named Adventure Network International) one of the founding members of IAATO in 1991 – conducted activities for the 31st consecutive season. 
    • The Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the 12th consecutive season and 8th as an IAATO Operator. 
    • White Desert (WDL), which operated in Antarctica for the 11th consecutive season and 6th as an IAATO Operator. Flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated through TAC. 
    • Arctic Trucks, which joined IAATO at the end of the 2013-14 season has operated in the Antarctic as a contractor since the 1990’s and as an Operator since the 2014-15 season.
    • ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and WDL operated out of Cape Town, South Africa. Arctic Trucks supported operations working from ALE and Novo camps.
The four companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in the field.
1.5.1	Visitor & Staff Numbers
Details of the visitor numbers can be found in the appendices below. Deep field operators usually maintain a higher client to staff ratio than is typical for seaborne tourism– often in the region of 1 guide to every 3 clients. The exception is with solo expeditions, for example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are supported remotely and closely through communication protocols, air drops and agreed search and rescue plans, etc. 
1.5.2	Aircraft Operations
ALE:
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between SCCI Punta Arenas, Chile, and SCGC Runway 18M Union Glacier. 
    • Two ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and one ski-wheel configured Basler DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the season.
TAC: 
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between Cape Town, South Africa and Novo Airbase.
    • One ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and on Basler BT-67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the season.
1.5.3 	Ground Transport
    • ALE operated a number of tractor traverses, primarily for more efficient transport of fuel and cargo, and to support scientific activities.
    • ALE, TAC, WDL and Arctic Trucks all used modified wheel vehicles. 
1.5.4	Camps (Primary)
    • ALE Union Glacier Camp opened October 20, 2016 and closed February 19, 2017.
    • TAC Camp opened October 29, 2016 and closed on February 27, 2017.
    • WDL Camp opened November 3, 2016 and closed on February 10, 2017.

1.5.5	Programs and Activities
Activities including the operation of standard programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions, and logistical support of other expeditions for the 2016-17 season, are outlined in the table below. Total numbers participating include clients from all four IAATO Deep Field Operators. Note that some clients participated in multiple programs.

1.6	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Operators.

For the 2016-17 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO Operators.

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2017-18 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2017-18 season.
IAATO Operators continue to refine the detail of their activity reporting. Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, snorkelling, skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, stand-up paddle boarding, camping (including short overnight stays), helicopter operations, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and underwater remote operated vehicles (ROVs).
For the 2017-18 season, those tourism categories where passengers land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts, all carrying 500 or fewer passengers – are expected to reach 39,378 passengers. The increase is due to two principle factors: a slight growth in air/cruise tourism which is projected to increase to 3,405 clients; and the introduction to the market of three new vessels Island Sky (116 passengers), Ocean Atlantic (175 passengers) and Silver Cloud (150 passengers) together conducting an additional 28 voyages, all to the Peninsula area.
Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no passengers landing ashore, is projecting a decrease of 15% to 6430 passengers. Air-land tourism, which is conducted by the four IAATO Operators that provide deep field excursions and expeditions, is projected to increase to 577 visitors.
No over-flights by IAATO Operators are expected during the 2017-18 season.
IAATO Operators will continue to work together to coordinate activities in advance, so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
