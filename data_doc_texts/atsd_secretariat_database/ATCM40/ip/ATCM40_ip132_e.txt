Aids to Antarctic navigation, beaconing and cartography
(2016-2017)

Presented by Argentina


Introduction
The Argentine Republic, through the Naval Hydrographic Service conducts the surveys, tasks, explorations and research aimed to promote the highest standards of navigation safety in Antarctica. The most recently performed activities are listed below.

Aids to Navigation  AIS AtoN
Complementing the information provided in IP 133 “Report on the installation of Aids to navigation on the Antarctic Continent”, this IP informs that, in response to the exponential increase in Antarctic navigation, the installation of SIA AtoN was undertaken jointly by the Argentine Navy, the Naval Hydrographic Service, the company Hidrovía S.A. and the National Directorate for the Antarctic (DNA). 

Indeed, during the recent Antarctic Summer Campaign 2016/2017, two new SIA AtoN were installed as a “test” at CARLINI and DECEPCIÓN Stations, each of them generating four virtual signals, detailed as follows:

The mentioned aids to maritime navigation complement the lighthouses and beacons installed by Argentina in Antarctica, an activity initiated in 1942 with the installation of the “Primero de Mayo” lighthouse and “Gallows Point” (“Punta Gallows”) beacon.


Beaconing
Argentina has and maintains eighty seven (87) maritime signals in the Antarctic region, comprised by two (2) lighthouses, seven (7) light beacons and seventy eight (78) unlit beacons. 

One lighthouse and all the beacons included in the previous paragraph use LED lighting. 

During the 2016/2017 Antarctic Summer Campaign, it was possible to inspect and repair twenty (20) of these maritime signals. 





Cartography
Currently, the National Antarctic Cartographic Plan has thirty on (31) charts, four (4) of which are Route and Approaching charts, eleven (11) are coastal and sixteen (16) are Insets. Furthermore, within the Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Argentina cooperates with the International Chart Scheme (INT) and its respective Electronic Nautical Charts (ENC), producing eleven (11) charts.

Currently, six (6) of them are already available, two (2) are in the process of being edited during 2017, two (2) are currently undergoing hydrographic surveys and one (1) is pending:

Currently undergoing hydrographical surveys
INT 9115 Dundee Island (Isla Dundee): Hydrographical survey 30% completed. 
INT 9140 South Orkney Islands (Islas Orcadas del Sur): Hydrographical survey 80% completed. In production process.

Pending
INT 9100 Seymour (Marambio) Island / Marambio Station: Execution of the hydrographical survey pending due to the severe glaciological conditions that characterize the area.
