Managing non-SOLAS vessels in the Southern Ocean
Information Paper Submitted by ASOC1

Summary
ASOC provides a brief summary of Southern Ocean shipping and the entry into force of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code). It identifies that the Polar Code is likely to only be relevant to under half the vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty area on an annual basis, since non-SOLAS vessels such as fishing vessels, pleasure craft and small cargo vessels are not currently covered by the safety provisions of the Polar Code. ASOC highlights an important opportunity to ensure that progress is made in commencing Phase 2 of work on the Polar Code in relation to non-SOLAS vessels, but identifies that concerted action is needed by ATCPs to ensure the best outcome at the forthcoming IMO Maritime Safety Committee meeting in June 2017. ASOC recommends that ATCPs: 
    • recognise that the work to date on the Polar Code does not apply to around half of the vessels operating in the Southern Ocean, and adopt an ATCM Decision on the need for concerted action at the IMO to ensure that Phase 2 of work on non-SOLAS vessels at the IMO commences urgently and concludes satisfactorily with no further delays; and

    • agree to provide views on safety standards for non-SOLAS vessels if the IMO again fails to place the previously agreed output “application of the mandatory code to non-SOLAS ships in polar waters” onto its live agenda.

Southern Ocean Shipping
Compared with many other oceans and seas, the nature of shipping in the Southern Ocean is specialised and focused largely on passenger ships, fishing vessels and reefers, research and re-supply vessels, and private and commercial yachts. Occasional cargo or tanker vessels operate in the region to re-supply research bases. IAATO’s provisional statistics for the 2015-2016 season2 indicated that 31 vessels operated in the Antarctic undertaking a total of 212 departures and that 15 sailing or motor yachts undertook 27 departures. These numbers were anticipated to rise for the 2016-17 season to 36 vessels and 17 sailing or motor yachts. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources’ (CCAMLR) list of authorised fishing vessels for the December 2016 – November 2017 season identifies 44 vessels permitted to operate in the Southern Ocean3. In addition to authorised fishing vessels, a further 18 vessels appear on the CCAMLR non-contracting party illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) vessel list4, though it should be noted that these may not be all operating in the Southern Ocean at any given time or even on an annual basis. In addition, further vessels maybe involved in transhipment of cargo, crew, fuel, and bait. The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs’ (COMNAP) database contains information for 43 vessels which are used or operated by National Antarctic Programmes (NAPs), or government entities, generally during the Antarctic summer season, which support national activities including research, research science support, logistics, operations, pas / cargo transport and supporting inspections / inspection teams. 27 of these vessels were in use at various times over the 2016 – 2017 summer Antarctic season, which is a typical number of vessels used by NAPs during any given summer season.5

The International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code)
The International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters or Polar Code entered into force on the 1st of January 2017. It introduces mandatory safety and pollution prevention requirements for ships operating in waters south of 60o S and in Arctic waters as defined in the Code. The Polar Code applies to passenger vessels and cargo ships over 500 gross tonnes (GT) and requires these vessels to have on board a Polar Ship Certificate and a Polar Water Operational Manual. Masters, chief mate and officers in charge of a navigational watch must have completed appropriate training for open-water operations and advanced training for operating in ice. Other requirements include the design and construction of ships which are tailored to different ship categories based on the type of ice a ship will operate in, materials which must be suitable for operation at the ship’s polar service temperature, and the stability of the vessel when subject to ice accretion. Provisions also include equipment standards for fire safety, lifeboats, and ice removal. Further details on the Polar Code are provided in the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) infographic6.  

The Polar Code also contains pollution prevention requirements addressing discharges of oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, sewage, and garbage. However the provisions add very little to the existing requirements for the waters south of 60o S. 

Extension of the Polar Code to non-SOLAS vessels (Phase 2)
While the Polar Code has been hailed as a historic milestone for the protection of ships and the people aboard the vessels operating in polar regions, the safety provisions implemented through the International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS), only apply to passenger vessels and cargo vessels over 500 GT, referred to as “SOLAS vessels”. So called “non-SOLAS vessels”, which include fishing vessels, pleasure crafts, and cargo vessels under 500 GT, are not required to comply with the safety requirements of the Polar Code. On the other hand, most of the pollution prevention measures as applied through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships (MARPOL Convention) are relevant to all vessels. 

Data on the numbers of vessels operating in polar regions indicate that 42% of the vessels operating in the Arctic in 2012 were fishing vessels and therefore not covered by the safety provisions of the Polar Code. While in the Antarctic, 31 passenger vessels operated in the 2015 – 2016 season, along with 15 sailing or motor yachts, and 41 authorised fishing vessels for the December 2015 –November 2017 fishing season, increasing to 44 authorised fishing vessels in the following season. Although 15 sailing or motor yachts were recorded by IAATO in 2015 – 2016 season, previous sightings in the Antarctic Peninsula region indicated as many as 36 yachts during 20147. Based on these figures, it is likely that more than 50% of the vessels operating in the Southern Ocean are not required to fulfil the requirements of the Polar Code, including all fishing vessels and sailing and motorised yachts.

ASOC is concerned that the threat to the Antarctic marine environment and also to human life by non SOLAS vessels has not yet been fully addressed. It can be seen from Table 1b that the Polar Code does not apply to more than half of the vessels operating in the Southern Ocean at the current time. Through ASOC Members, information on 21 recent incidents involving non-SOLAS vessels from 10 flag States that have occurred in Arctic and Antarctic waters and on the numbers and types of vessels operating in polar waters has been supplied to the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) at its 95th, 96th and 97th session, and also to the fourth session of the IMO’s sub-committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC)8. These 21 incidents have led to the death and loss of nearly 150 crew members and to spills of fuel oil. ASOC believes that lessons should be drawn from recent non-SOLAS vessel incidents in the Southern Ocean to urgently progress work to extend the Polar Code to non-SOLAS vessels.

ASOC is aware that discussion will be required to agree on how measures applicable to non-SOLAS vessels should be addressed. However, ASOC firmly believes that once the work has identified the necessary measures to improve the safety of non-SOLAS vessels in polar waters, it will be easier to identify the most appropriate route to introduce the measures. With this in mind, ASOC has considered recent incidents (summarised in submissions to the IMO9) in the context of the current chapters of the Polar Code Part 1 (Safety Measures), providing an early indication of the areas of safety for consideration with respect to three categories of non-SOLAS vessels. It should be noted that this is a preliminary assessment and is not intended to indicate that the current requirements of the Polar Code Part 1 can be transferred directly to non-SOLAS vessels. The main conclusion is that these aspects of safety should be considered and appropriate measures agreed for application to different categories of non-SOLAS vessels operating in polar waters.

Following discussions at IMO meetings MSC 95, MSC 96, MSC 97 and SDC 4 (which have taken place over the past two years), Phase 2 of work on the Polar Code will be considered again at MSC 98 between 7th – 16th June 2017. MSC has been requested to make a policy decision on how this work should be structured and provide clear instructions on when the development of Phase 2 should begin. The scope of application of Phase 2 and the provision of advice on the recommendatory or mandatory status on Phase 2 should also be addressed. To facilitate discussion, in particular discussions on the recommendatory or mandatory status of Phase 2, ASOC (through ASOC Members with Consultative Status at the IMO) has submitted an information paper to the MSC 98 meeting10. This paper provides extracts from a Legal Memo prepared for ASOC on the Potential Application of Polar Code to Fishing Vessels and Yachts and is included as an attachment to this IP11. The Legal Memo examines SOLAS, the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977, the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol (SFV), and the 2012 Cape Town Agreement and other potentially useful IMO Conventions as well as voluntary guidelines or a new convention. It then analyses which might be the most useful and amendable to apply some, or all, of the applicable Polar Code safety provisions to fishing vessels and pleasure craft operating in polar waters. The information presented in the submission (MSC 98/INF3) is provided as a contribution to the discussions that are urgently required to instigate Phase 2 of the Polar Code work on non-SOLAS vessels.

Action by ATCM 
ASOC is concerned that approximately half of the vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty area  are not required to conform to the safety measures established by the Polar Code, and therefore, calls on ATCM Parties to support concerted action at the IMO during the forthcoming 98th Session of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting and beyond to ensure that the safety of vessel operation in the Antarctic Treaty area is addressed as a matter of urgency. ASOC believes that if addressing Phase 2 of work on the Polar Code is further delayed, the Antarctic Treaty Parties should “pick-up the baton” and consider developing guidance under the ATCM and CCAMLR for the safe operation of non-SOLAS vessels in the Southern Ocean, thus ensuring both the safety of vessels and human lives and improving the protection of the Antarctic marine environment. 

Recommendations
ASOC Recommends that Antarctic Treaty Contracting Parties (ATCPs): 
    • recognise that the work to date on the Polar Code does not apply to approximately half of the vessels operating in the Southern Ocean, and adopt an ATCM Decision on the need for concerted action at the IMO to ensure that Phase 2 of work on non-SOLAS vessels commences urgently and concludes satisfactorily with no further delays; and

    • agree to provide views on safety standards for non-SOLAS vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area if the IMO again fails to place the previously agreed output “application of the mandatory code to non-SOLAS ships in polar waters” onto is live agenda.
