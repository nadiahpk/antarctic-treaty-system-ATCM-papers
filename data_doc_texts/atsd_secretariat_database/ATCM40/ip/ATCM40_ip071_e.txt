Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden

Summary
In October 2016, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted Conservation Measure 24-04, “Establishing time-limited Special Areas for Scientific Study in newly exposed marine areas following ice shelf retreat or collapse in Statistical Subareas 48.1, 48.5 and 88.3”, following a proposal by the European Union and its Member States. This measure is designed to promote and facilitate scientific research in such areas around the Antarctic Peninsula region, during a 10-year study period in which fishing activities may only take place subject to the conditions set out for scientific research fishing. This paper describes the mechanism for designation of Special Areas for Scientific Study, and the management measures that will apply in these areas. Annex 1 provides scientific background on recent ice shelf retreat and collapse in the Antarctic Peninsula region, and on the unique research opportunities provided by newly exposed marine areas.  
Introduction
Recent rapid climate change is now well documented in the Antarctic, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula region. One of the most evident signs of climate change has been glacial retreat and the collapse of ice shelves; overall 87% of the Peninsula’s glaciers have retreated in recent decades. Further ice shelf collapse will lead to the creation of new habitats, with consequent changes in both ecological processes and in community structure. Habitats revealed by collapsed or retreating ice shelves therefore offer unique opportunities for scientific studies relating to habitat colonisation, providing valuable insights into how these communities develop over a range of time scales. 
The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change (2010) recommended that consideration be given to the means by which automatic interim protection might be afforded to marine areas exposed through ice shelf collapse (ATME Recommendation 26). CCAMLR first discussed potential mechanisms for such protection following a proposal by the United Kingdom in 2011 (WS-MPA-11/17; SC-CAMLR-XXX/13; SC-CAMLR-XXX Report, paragraphs 5.67 to 5.77). A subsequent proposal by the European Union and its Member States was agreed by the Commission in 2016 (CCAMLR-XXXV/13, Rev.1; CCAMLR XXXV Report, paragraphs 5.86 to 5.90; CM 24-04). The Scientific Committee agreed that the proposal had scientific merit, and that it was an appropriate and practicable response to the issue originally raised at the 2010 ATME on Climate Change (SC-CAMLR-XXXV, paragraph 8.10). 
Designation of Special Areas for Scientific Study
Special Areas for Scientific Study may be designated in any newly exposed marine area following the retreat or collapse of an ice shelf, glacier or ice tongue in the Antarctic Peninsula region (CCAMLR Statistical Subareas 48.1, 48.5 and 88.3) shown in Figure 1.
The retreat of ice shelves, glaciers or ice tongues is defined as the landward movement of the ice front such that there is a loss of more than 10% of the areal extent of an individual ice shelf, glacier or ice tongue within any 10 year period from 2016 onwards. Collapse is defined as the break up or disintegration of an ice shelf, glacier or ice tongue over a period that may be shorter than 10 years. 
Special Areas for Scientific Study shall be designated in two stages. This provides an automatic review period to allow for detailed inspection of the available data, whilst maintaining a precautionary approach. An initial, two-year period (Stage 1) would begin immediately following a collapse or retreat. Any Member recording the retreat or collapse of an ice shelf or glacier (as defined above) shall inform the CCAMLR Secretariat as soon as practicable of the proposed Stage 1 area, corresponding to the area of ice loss. The Stage 1 area would then be deemed designated 48 hours after all Members have been notified. This is a provisional designation to allow time for detailed review of the available data, including any relevant fishery research proposals. 
Following the initial Stage 1 designation, the available data and proposed boundaries would then be considered in detail by the Scientific Committee and its Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM). Once agreed by the CCAMLR Commission, the proposed Special Area would be established for a 10-year period (Stage 2), and its details appended to Conservation Measure 24-04 and made available on the CCAMLR website. However, if no agreement is reached after the initial two-year period, then the Stage 1 Special Area would expire. Ten years is considered to be the minimum time period needed for scientific activities in Antarctica to be designed, organised and funded, and for initial results to become available. During both Stage 1 and Stage 2, the same management measures would apply, as described below. 
All Stage 2 designations shall expire at the end of the 10-year study period. Any proposal to extend the period of designation for a Stage 2 Special Area for Scientific Study must be made as a new Commission proposal, either through the defined process for designating Stage 2 Special Areas, or as a specific, separate conservation measure for special area management.
Management measures
Scientific research is encouraged in Special Areas for Scientific Study following ice-shelf collapse or retreat, particularly in order to understand the ecosystem processes in relation to climate change. Scientific research may be undertaken in Stage 1 Special Areas as well as Stage 2 Special Areas, if practicable.
Stage 1 or Stage 2 Special Area can be opened for research fishing in accordance with the conditions set out in the Conservation Measure, and subject to a research plan agreed by Commission upon advice from the Scientific Committee and its working groups.
Members planning to initiate, or undertake any non-fisheries-related scientific research or monitoring on marine living resources within any Stage 1 or Stage 2 Special Area for Scientific Study are encouraged to inform the Scientific Committee of their intended research plans, and also to subsequently report any results relevant to the work of the Commission and the Scientific Committee.
No discharges and no dumping of any type of waste by any fishing vessel shall take place within Special Areas for Scientific Study. Transhipment activities involving fishing vessels are prohibited, and for the purposes of monitoring vessel traffic within Special Areas for Scientific Study, transiting fishing vessels are encouraged to inform the CCAMLR Secretariat of their intended transit prior to entering any Special Area for Scientific Study
Monitoring
Calculations of incremental retreat of ice shelves, glaciers or ice tongues, or the total area of collapse, shall be based upon ice coastline boundaries contained in the periodic updates of the SCAR Antarctic Digital Database (www.add.scar.org), or upon other relevant scientific information if available, including high-resolution satellite imagery.

Conclusion
The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change, held in 2010, recommended that, “recognising the responsibilities of and need to coordinate with CCAMLR, that the CEP consider, and advise the ATCM accordingly, as to means by which automatic interim protection might be afforded to newly exposed areas, such as marine areas exposed through ice-shelf collapse” (Recommendation 10 – see also ATCM XL/SP08).  The co-proponents of this paper invite the ATCM and the CEP to take note of CCAMLR Conservation Measure CM 24-04, as summarised in this paper, as a positive contribution towards the delivery of this recommendation.

Annex 1: Scientific background

    1. Recent, rapid climate change is now well documented in the Antarctic, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Solomon et al., 2007), which has experienced strong atmospheric warming since the 1950s (Turner et al, 2014). Changes in the physical properties of the marine system are especially important for CCAMLR and include, inter alia, changes in ocean temperature (Gille, 2002) and ocean acidification (Bednaršek et al, 2012), reductions in the extent and timing of seasonal sea ice (Stammerjohn et al, 2008) and the retreat and collapse of ice shelves, glaciers and ice tongues (Cook and Vaughan, 2010; Cook et al, 2005; Gutt et al, 2010, 2013; Rignot et al, 2013). Nevertheless, the implications for biological systems remain poorly understood, particularly for how rapidly physical changes might cascade through marine foodwebs. Designation of Special Areas for Scientific Study will facilitate the study of the effects of such changes in the absence of any effects caused by other human activities (Trathan et al, 2013). In this respect, ice shelf collapse is of special importance, as it opens up new marine habitats for biological colonisation and ecological succession.
    2. One of the most evident signs of climate change has been ice shelf collapse; overall, 87% of the Peninsula’s glaciers have retreated in recent decades (Cook et al, 2005). Retreat can be gradual, such as the retreat of the northern edge of the George VI ice shelf over a number of years between 1974 and 1995 (Scambos et al, 2000); it can be rapid, such as the retreat of the Wilkins ice shelf in 1998 (Scambos et al, 2000), or it can be catastrophic, such as the final collapse of the remnants of the Larsen A, which disintegrated in late January 1995 (Rott et al, 1996), and the Larsen B, which disintegrated within a period of just a few days in 2002, losing an area of ~3,370 km2 (MacAveal et al, 2003). The collapse of the Larsen B followed a series of warm summers on the Antarctic Peninsula, and an exceptionally warm summer in 2002 (MacAveal et al, 2003). Significant surface melting due to warmer air temperatures created melt ponds on the surface of the Larsen B, which acted like wedges to deepen crevasses and eventually caused the shelf to splinter. As the surface melt ponds began to fracture the shelf, strong winds or waves might have caused the shelf to flex, helping to trigger the catastrophic break up (Scambos et al, 2000, 2003). A reduction in buttressing by the remnant ice shelf is thought to be increasing the likelihood of collapse of the remaining Larsen B ice shelf (Khazendar et al, 2015).
    3. Recent mass and dynamic changes suggest that the Larsen C ice shelf may have similar potential instabilities to those recorded for the Larsen A and B ice shelves, and could suffer the same fate (Kulessa et al, 2014, Holland et al, 2015). The Larsen C is vulnerable to changes in both oceanic and atmospheric forcing, as well as instabilities caused by un-grounding of the ice shelf (Holland et al, 2015), and there have been observations of widespread thinning, development of melt ponds, and an increase in ice flow speed (Jansen et al, 2015). A northwards-propagating rift from Gipps Ice Rise has recently advanced towards the centre of the ice shelf and continues to grow in extension and width (Jansen et al, 2016). By February 2017 the rift had extended to a distance of only 20 km from the ice front, with the calving of a 5000 km2 iceberg (more than 10% of the ice shelf area) now likely (www.projectmidas.org).
    4. Across the Antarctic as a whole, the highest thinning rates occur where warm water at depth can access ice shelves via submarine troughs crossing the continental shelf, causing basal melting (Pritchard et al, 2012; Cook et al 2016). This is particularly evident for ice shelves on the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea coasts such as the Venable and Pine Island ice shelves, and also for the Stange and George VI ice shelves in the western Antarctic Peninsula (Pritchard et al, 2012).
    5. Ice-shelf retreat or collapse will lead to new marine habitats and to biological colonisation. Peck et al. (2010) showed that the loss of ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula in the last 50 years has exposed at least 2.4 × 104 km2 of new open water (see also Vaughan and Doake, 1996). These newly revealed habitats have allowed new phytoplankton blooms to be produced (Bertolin and Schloss, 2009) resulting in new marine zooplankton and seabed communities. In general, fauna under ice shelves exist in oligotrophic conditions, and because ice shelf collapse may lead to greater nutrient input, there may be consequent loss of some species or communities (Gutt et al, 2010, 2011). The ecosystems that form following ice shelf collapse will be susceptible to colonisation by new species from areas that are immediately adjacent to the new habitat; however, other complex processes may also take place as warming waters may create opportunities for species to return that were last present in the last interglacial, a warmer period than at present. In addition, altered ecosystem dynamics may allow new species to invade as ocean warming potentially removes physiological barriers that have previously led to the isolation of the Antarctic benthos (Clarke et al, 2004; Barnes and Peck, 2008; Aronson et al, 2009; Smith et al, 2011). Further discussion of the potential ecological effects and scientific opportunities that may arise from ice shelf collapse and retreat can be found in Trathan et al, 2013.
    6. Marine habitats previously covered by ice shelves present outstanding opportunities for scientific study, and will provide valuable insights into how communities develop over timescales ranging from years to decades. Gutt et al (2011) describe studies of the structure of ecosystems exposed following ice shelf collapse, undertaken 12 and 5 years after the respective collapses of the Larsen A and B ice shelves. They reported major ecosystem impacts resulting from the change from an oligotrophic sub-ice-shelf ecosystem to a productive shelf ecosystem, and from iceberg scour.
    7. Different ice shelves will present different opportunities for the study of colonisation as regional climate change proceeds over the course of this century.   In order to increase levels of understanding and develop new monitoring methods, it will be beneficial for a variety of organisations to work together, including international organisations such as SCAR, and especially its science programs Antarctic Thresholds-Ecosystem Resilience and Adaptation (AnT-ERA) and State of the Antarctic Ecosystem (AntEco), ICED (Integrating Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean; www.iced.ac.uk), SOOS (The Southern Ocean Observing System; www.soos.aq) and Sentinel (Southern Ocean Sentinel; Constable and Doust., 2009).
