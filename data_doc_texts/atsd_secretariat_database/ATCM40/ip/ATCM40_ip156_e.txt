Greening of established infrastructure and logistics in Antarctica

Summary

This document summarises the steps Norway has taken towards exploring the options for making Norwegian infrastructure and logistics in Antarctica greener. This includes steps to decrease the carbon footprint related to fuel use in the research station, transport of personnel to Antarctica, as well as transport of cargo by ship to the Norwegian station. The document also summarises a mini-seminar on greening of stations arranged by the Norwegian Polar Institute in Tromsø in 2015. The Norwegian Antarctic program will continue to work to further improve its infrastructure in Antarctica. 


Background

Norway has a long tradition of research in Antarctica. Norway has been carrying out research since as early as the 1920s and the 1930s. Norwegian research activity to Antarctica has been carried out on regular basis since 1976-77. Norway established Troll research station in Dronning Maud Land (DML) as a seasonal summer station in 1990, . Troll station was re-constructed into a year-round station in 2005. Simultaneously, a blue-ice airstrip was established in the proximity of the station, allowing for intercontinental flights directly to Troll research station. The Norwegian Antarctic national program has overall increased its activity, and consequently, environmental friendly and sustainable solutions have received increased attention. 


Greening of established infrastructure and logistic systems
The infrastructure and logistics associated with Norwegian activity are conventional and robust, in line with the vast majority of national programmes carrying out activity in Antarctica. The transition towards sustainable and innovative solutions such as zero/low emission and self-sustainable systems is a future goal. 
Norway recognises that several treaty members have established new and innovative stations during the last decade, underlining that there is a collective move towards green development. The Norwegian national program looks with keen interest to the experiences and lessons learned by other operators, and use these as inspiration in its effort to green its operations. 

The national Norwegian programme is an active partner in COMNAP (Council of Managers of Antarctic Program). The national operator for the Norwegian Antarctic program are looking into several systems and solutions on how to move toward greening of operational footprints. 

The national Norwegian programme invited several national Antarctic programs to a mini-seminar in Tromsø on the 25th of August in 2015 in conjunction with the annual COMNAP meeting of that year. Several members from comparable national programs attended. The intent was to bring up and look into best practice, and acknowledged current and planned solutions and standards, in order to inspire further discussions and developments in the Norwegian Antarctic program. 

The seminar focused on main and subtopics such as: 
    • Energy and energy storage
        ◦ Status 
        ◦ Experience / best practice 
        ◦ Available systems / technology
        ◦ The future
    • Effective and environmental friendly logistic solutions
        ◦ Status
        ◦ Experience and best practice
        ◦ Available systems / technology
        ◦ The future
            ▪ Science support
            ▪ Air operations (intra and intercontinental flights)
            ▪ Shipping 
    • Waste management (incl. waste water treatment)
        ◦ Status 
        ◦ Experience / best practice 
        ◦ Available systems / technology
        ◦ The future
    • Making old infrastructure greener and proceeding towards certification
        ◦ Starting point 
        ◦ Opportunities / Potentials 
        ◦ Experience / best practice 
        ◦ Available systems / technology
        ◦ The future

As for the Norwegian activity in Antarctica, the following categories are currently in focus: 
    • Greening of Troll station
    • Greener transport of personnel 
    • Greener transport of provisions and goods 

In 2015 – 16, the Norwegian National Antarctic programme facilitated a conceptual study called “Troll green station”. This study looked into the possibility for the “Integration of a Solar Powered Fuel Saver at Troll Station, Antarctica”. In summary, the study investigated the possibility of developing established infrastructure into a hybrid solution using conventional and established energy sources. The study demonstrates that the amount of fuel saved by changing over to a hybrid system using a solar powered fuel saver together with conventional and established energy sources, could be up to 50%. The initial investment is relatively high, however the fuel saving indicates that the investment could be written off within an acceptable timeframe. 

In relation to the transport of personnel, the Norwegian programme has looked into the market of different airframes and operators. By upgrading the systems affiliated with the flight operations, and the runway to Troll station to a higher recognised standards within the International Civil Aviation Authorities (ICAO), it has allowed the Norwegian Antarctic program to contract operators with long range and fuel-efficient airframes. This has reduced the overall carbon footprint per passenger by a considerable amount. Norway is still exploring how to develop this concept further, to continue to reduce the need for refuelling aircrafts i.e. in order to reduce overland transport i.e. 

Shipping is another area where steps have been taken to reduce the carbon footprint of national programs. National programs with stations in Dronning Maud Land are continuously looking into joint contracts on vessels, facilitating ship calls to several stations in DML. This cooperation demonstrates that by joining resources, operators can both lower the cost and environmental impact of transportation to the Antarctic. 

Conclusion 
Bilateral and multilateral relations between national operators is important in order to develop and foster synergetic effects. COMNAP plays an instrumental role in fostering cooperative development of the systems of individual operators, and in creating synergy through sharing of logistic resources. 

The availability of robust systems for alternative energy has reached a recognised volume in the market. This should enable Antarctic operators to develop infrastructure, and further reduce their footprint in Antarctica, whilst still maintaining and developing important science and monitoring systems. The initial cost is relatively high. However – with further development of the systems into shelf ware Norway believes that sustainable systems could be a realistic option for most national programs going forward. 

National programs establishing and upgrading infrastructure share the universal challenge of balancing the cost of capital investment, running costs, risk, and expected lifespan. The Norwegian Antarctic program will continue to work to further improve its infrastructure in Antarctica.
