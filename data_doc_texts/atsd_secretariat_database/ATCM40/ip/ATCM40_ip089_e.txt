Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Internship Grant
 for Republic of Turkey


The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) granted a four-weeks, full-time internship in Buenos Aires to Mr. Onur Sabri Durak, Legal Advisor of Istanbul Technical University Polar Research Center (ITU PolReC) between January 2 and January 31 of 2017. The aim of the internship at the ATS has been to understand the working mechanisms and functions of the ATS and familiarizing with preparatory documents of the ATCM. During the internship, Mr. Durak had a crucial information exchange between the ATS and his home country. The internship experience of Mr. Durak has been useful for Turkish Antarctic Expedition – I (TAE-I) in providing environmental protection knowledge for the Expedition members. 

The internship opportunity granted by the ATS has been welcomed by Turkish authorities. Therefore, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the ATS and all ATCM community. We believe that, this internship opportunity allowed Turkish experts to better understand the Antarctic Treaty System and Antarctic policy.
