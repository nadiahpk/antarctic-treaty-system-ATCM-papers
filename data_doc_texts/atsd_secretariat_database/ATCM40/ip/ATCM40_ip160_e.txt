Maritime Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia: from the beginning of the activity to present times1
Summary
This document summarizes the evolution of Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia from the beginning of this activity in the 1957/1958 Antarctic summer season up to present times. Different periods are considered regarding the development of tourism as an activity; the number of voyages and of transported passengers as well as other data of interest is taken into account for the analysis.
Introduction
Ushuaia, located on the northern coast of the Beagle Channel, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic ship-borne tourism, given that more than 90 % of Antarctic visitors use the port of Ushuaia at least once, either for embarkation and/or disembarkation, in their Antarctic voyage.
Antarctic tourism can be defined as the commercial activity involving the travelling of persons south of 60º S or Antarctic Treaty Area, for leisure purposes, paying special attention to motivations related to wildlife, dramatic landscapes, scientific interest and exploration history. This type of tourism requires the support given by city gateways in order to be able to carry out the voyages.
Even though Antarctic tourism had preceded the sign of Antarctic Treaty in 1959, tourism was not mentioned at all therein. Nevertheless, later on, different instances related to the activity were adopted at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, generating an adequate frame for the development of tourism.
The purpose of this information paper is to show the evolution of Antarctic tourist flows through the port of Ushuaia, from the beginning of the activity in the 1957/1958 Austral summer season up to the present. To do so, a division by periods was undertaken according to the key factors that determined the tourist ship-borne flows to Antarctica.
The main sources of information belong to the Inbound and Outbound registry of vessels at the port of Ushuaia 1949-2000 and 2001-2010 and to the manifests2 provided by cruise ships, all of which are kept by  the Argentine Maritime Authority. Other bibliographic material was also consulted3. 
Beginning and evolution of voyages and visitors’ flows during an initial stage
Before the development of Antarctic tourism as a commercial activity, many people, who were not related to Antarctic tasks, participated in logistic and research voyages organized by public institutions. For example, in 1933 the Argentine Navy vessel Pampa, making a relief voyage to the Observatory on Laurie Island, carried a group of visitors, including Captain Jordan (American Naval Attaché) and his family, as special foreign guests (the latter group disembarked in Ushuaia due to bad weather). In a similar manner, many visitors reached Antarctica as special guests on voyages organized by State Operators. 
First voyages organized by the end of the fifties
Maritime tourism towards Antarctica started in the 1957/1958 season, when Argentina organized two journeys on board the vessel Les Eclairerus. These voyages were possible given the previous experience achieved through hydrographical, oceanographic, meteorological and glaciological studies, field exploration and scientific research. The first voyage to Antarctica departed from Ushuaia on January 16th 1958, carrying 98 passengers and visiting five stations operated by Argentina. These first Antarctic visitors unveiled a commemorative plaque in the main building of Decepción Station, since it was the first place in Antarctica where they landed. The second voyage departed from Ushuaia, on January 31st, with 96 passengers on board. 
On January 1959, the vessel Yapeyú, belonging to the Argentine Overseas Fleet (Flota Argentina de Navegación de Ultramar) made a sixteen-day voyage, carrying 262 passengers, departing from Buenos Aires to the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, making a stop in Ushuaia on the way back, on February 6th. 
In the last years of this decade, three tourist voyages took place, carrying 456 passengers. They account for the 0.07 % of the historic total of voyages and the 0.08 % of the historic total of visitors, considering the whole period up through the 2016/2017 season (see Table 2).
These voyages had been the only ones organized before the Antarctic Treaty was signed, and were undertaken by governmental operators, operating under the flag of the organizing country4. These first experiences would demonstrate the technical viability to make these voyages and the interest of tourists in visiting these remote areas as well as the possibility of having logistical support capacities. Furthermore, the feeling of adventure as well as the beauty encountered highly satisfied visitors’ expectations.
The continuity of Antarctic tourism in the ‘60s
During the 60’s, tourist voyages started in the 1965/1966 season. In January 1966, Lindblad Travel, registered in New York, together with Astra travel agency, located in Buenos Aires, chartered the vessel Lapataia from the Naval Transport Command (Comando de Transportes Navales) in order to organize the “First International Survey Voyage” to Antarctica in January 1966. The ship left Buenos Aires on January 13th, calling at the ports of Mar del Plata and Ushuaia and, once in Antarctica, passengers visited some research stations (Brown, Decepción and Esperanza). 
In 1967 Lindblad Travel again rented the vessel Lapataia and made two voyages to Antarctica. During the following two seasons they chartered Chilean and Danish vessels, trying new itineraries which did not register calls at the port of Ushuaia.
The vessel Lapataia would later return to Antarctica with tourists in the summer of 1968.
For the 1968/1969 season, the National Tourism Board (Dirección Nacional de Turismo) organized a series of four voyages named “White Continent Cruises”. Voyages were made with the vessel Libertad5, belonging to the Argentine State Maritime Line Company (Empresa Líneas Marítimas del Estado). 
Summing up, during this decade 8 voyages took place, carrying 1,394 passengers that represented 0.20 % of historic total of voyages and 0.23 % of the historic total of passengers, considering the whole period through the 2016/2017 season. 
The main characteristics of this decade refer to the continuity of voyages encouraged by Argentine official entities on the one hand and, on the other, the beginning of private sector organized trips, led by Lars Eric Lindblad, who chartered vessels from different countries, trying new itineraries that departed from different places: Buenos Aires and Ushuaia (Argentina), Punta Arenas (Chile) and Lyttelton (New Zealand). Vessels were registered to original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty. 
As the private sector began operating tourism in Antarctica, at the IV ATCM that took place in Santiago, Chile in 1966, the first Recommendation related to tourism was adopted (Recommendation ATCM IV-27).
The first maritime Antarctic tourist “boom” in the ‘70s
During this decade tourist activity was distributed between the private sector initiatives and those promoted by different governmental agencies from Argentina.
The National Tourism Board was the governmental entity that encouraged tourism to Antarctica and voyages were organized with the vessels Río Tunuyán and Libertad. In 1974 and for two seasons, the National Under -Secretary for Sports and Tourism (Subsecretaría de Deportes y Turismo de la Nación), chartered the Panamanian flagged vessel Regina Prima, making 6 voyages for the 1974/1975 season and 7 for the following season.
In 1970, when the vessel Lindblad Explorer (first vessel specially designed for polar waters) started with the voyages to Antarctica, the “expedition cruise” concept was developed. This refers to the organization of voyages to remote destinations where the ship provides not only the access to the location but also the stay, covering all passengers’ needs. The ship manager organizes the land-based activities, as well as lectures on board in charge of specialists on different topics. During the following seasons in this decade, the Lindblad Explorer made different voyages calling at the port of Ushuaia. It is interesting to point out at a voyage that took place in the 1973/1974 season, departing from the port of Bluff (New Zealand) to Antarctica and ending in Ushuaia. This voyage lasted 35 days and became the first “Antarctic semi-circumnavigation”. 
In the 1972/1973 season the Spanish company Ybarra organized a voyage named “First Antarctic Cruise and Midnight Sun6” aboard the vessel Cabo San Roque, carrying 720 passengers, passengers were divided into two classes on the ship. This company continued with five voyages in the following years.
In January 1973, the vessel Enrico C, belonging to the Costa Line Fleet, called at the port of Ushuaia carrying 888 passengers, coming from Antarctica. Another cruise company, the Society Expedition Cruises, started operating in 1977 with the vessel World Discoverer, making two voyages in the 1977/1978 season, carrying 282 passengers 
In this decade, 63 voyages took place, carrying 16,824 passengers, which represented 1.55 % of the historic total of voyages and 2.81 % of the historic total of passengers (considering the whole period through the 2016/2017 season).
This tourist “boom” in the seventies is characterized by the continuous activity throughout all the seasons and the active participation of the Argentine government as well as the private-sector involvement. Voyages organized aboard large ships played a significant role in this decade. A specially designed vessel to navigate in polar waters initiated her operations in Antarctica, and some vessels under convenience flags begin to operate.
The stagnation phase in the ‘80s
In the  Antarctic tourism decreased considerably. In the 1979/1980 season, the National Tourism Board organized its last voyage aboard the vessel Bahía Buen Suceso. From this season onwards, the private sector took on the initiative and, therefore, in 1980/1981, the travel agency Antartur7, based in Ushuaia, organized a voyage aboard the vessel Bahía Buen Suceso, carrying 70 passengers. Two other voyages took place during the following seasons, carrying 139 visitors. Antartur continued with voyages to Antarctica in the 1985/1986 austral summer season, by partially chartering berths from the polar vessel Bahía Paraíso organizing voyages for the following three seasons. In this respect, it is should be noted that a publication titled “Antartur Antarctic Visitors’ Handbook” was developed, where rules of conduct were specified according to Argentine legal standards as an original Antarctic Treaty signatory country. Activities organized by foreign companies continued with the vessel Lindblad Explorer, y el Society. In the 1988/1989 season the Russian flagged vessel Antonina Nezhdanova started journeys to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, making seven voyages. These voyages anticipated the sustained increase of Antarctic seaborne tourism which began during the following decade.
In summary, during the eighties a total of 33 voyages took place, carrying 3,017 passengers that represented the 0.81 % of the historic total of voyages and the 0.50 % of the historic total of passengers, considering the whole period through the 2016/2017 season (see Table 2).
Both the government and the private sector activities organized from Argentina finished by the end of this decade and tour operators experienced new itineraries.
In Figure 1 the evolution of both vessels and passenger movements can be seen. It summarizes the first 30 years of Antarctic seaborne tourism through the port of Ushuaia. It shows the variations in the first years, the boom of the seventies and the decrease of the eighties. The 1977/1978 season was the longest summer season in terms of voyages lasting 82 days (see Figure 2). We can see that three decades were needed for the development of seaborne Antarctic tourism in order for it to be able to consolidate in the following seasons.

The sustained growth of Antarctic seaborne tourism and the consolidation of Ushuaia as a gateway in the ‘90s.
In the ‘90s Antarctic seaborne tourism was organized by initiatives coming from the foreign private sector. Several exogenous and endogenous factors highly contributed to this development. Among the first ones, the increased availability of charter vessels on the market as well as skilled human resources on polar issues can be mentioned. On the second case, suitable infrastructure developed in Ushuaia helped the consolidation of this activity. With regard to the infrastructure developed in Ushuaia, the construction of the international airport and the extension of the pier should be underscored. In 1995 the new runway was opened (2,460 m long) with a different orientation to favour the taking off and landing operations. In 1997 the new passenger terminal was finished and this, together with the runway, opened a new possibility for the operation of large aircrafts. In this way, the frequency of flights increased significantly, providing Antarctic tour operators with more flights and the choice of charter flights in order to facilitate the intermodal (airport-port) change over of passengers. Likewise, in 1999, the pier was expanded reaching 520 m, allowing an increase in the number of berths. These conditions together with the natural characteristics of deep waters and sheltered bay benefited the operations of Antarctic tourist vessels.
Although in the 1989/1990 season only 8 voyages that carried 960 passengers took place, in the following seasons an important increase of vessels as well as voyages and passengers occurred. The season extended to 105 days and continued growing up to the 1995/1996 season, when it reached 147 days (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Expansion of Antarctic summer seasons from 1957/1958 to 2016/2017



In this decade a significant increase in the number of vessels, voyages and passengers occurred when the foreign private sector initiative developed. Additionally, most of the vessels that operated in this decade carried between 50 and 100 passengers. Ushuaia consolidated as a base port and more than the 90 % of Antarctic maritime tourism operated through this gateway.  
In regard to this decade, 585 voyages were made, carrying 55,013 passengers, which represented the 14.36 % of the historic total of voyages and the 9.20 % of the total visitors, considering the whole period through the 2016/2017 season (see Table 2). 
The development of Antarctic seaborne tourism by the End of the Millennium and the beginning of the XXI century 
During the 1999/2000 summer season, several special itineraries were designed inspired by the End of the Millennium celebrations, producing an important increase in the number of voyages, but especially in the number of passengers, reaching an increase of 50 % compared to the previous season.
It is in that decade that there is South American participation in the Antarctic tourism industry for the first time: tour operator Antarpply Expeditions, founded by argentine nationals and based in Ushuaia, began its operations with the ship Ushuaia in the 2002/2003 season. From the following season onwards it carried out between 9 and 14 voyages per season. Furthermore, the vessel Antarctic Dream (former Piloto Pardo), owned by the Chilean tour operator Antarctic Shipping, operated regularly from the 2005/2006 to the 2011/2012 summer seasons, completing a total of 88 voyages. 
Large vessels, progressively increasing their capacity, began to include Antarctica in their itineraries. These voyages either start in South American ports, or are part of more extended itineraries around South America or around the world, calling at the port of Ushuaia when going to, or returning from, Antarctica. The first “Very Large Cruise Vessel” (VLCV) voyage, the Golden Princess, with a capacity for 3,100 passengers, took place during the 2006/2007 season.
The 2007/2008 season was the busiest one regarding this kind of activity, with 44,605 passengers travelling to Antarctica by ship, through the port of Ushuaia. The following season, 2008/2009, was the longest, reaching 179 days (see Figure 2). The preservation of the Antarctic environment and the development of sustainable tourism were already present in the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) agenda. Vessels carrying more than 500 passengers did not make any landings in Antarctica due to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)’s regulations for their members. These limitations were adopted by the ATCM in 2007 –Resolution 4 (2007)- and 2009 –Measure 15.
Since the amendment to Annex 1 to MARPOL (IMO) banning the use and/or transport of heavy fuel South of the 60º S, entered into force on August 2011, large vessels decreased their presence from the 2011/2012 season.
During the first decade of the XXI century, 1,741 voyages were made, carrying 244,582 passengers, which represented 42.74 % of the historic total of voyages and 40.91 % of the total visitors, considering the whole period up to the 2016/2017 season (see Table 2).
Current characteristics of Antarctic seaborne tourism through Ushuaia port
Seaborne tourism has had a more significant growth compared to other forms of tourism in Antarctica. 
Most tour operators that commercialize Antarctica either own their vessels and/or charter them from different vessel owners (the vessels could be totally chartered, or it could be done regarding only some of its capacity). Most tour operators specialize in expedition cruises to both the Arctic and the Antarctic, and they sometimes include other remote destinations. Most of them are IAATO members, the only organization that deals with this activity in Antarctica. In recent years, the fleets of vessels have been renovated, decreasing the number of vessels with capacity for less 100 passengers, in favour of  those with a carrying capacity of between 100 a 200 passengers, besides including sophisticated equipment in order to experience better views and different activities.
In some cases, vessels make the positioning voyage from or to the Northern Hemisphere (depending on whether it is the beginning or the end of the season) carrying passengers, while in other cases the positioning voyage is made only with the crew.
There is a group of cruises which, besides being IAATO members, they also belong to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), such as Azamara Club Cruises, Celebrity Cruise Line, Hapag Lloyd Cruises, Holland America Line, Hurtigruten, Lindblad Expeditions, Ponant Expeditions, Seabourn Cruise Line, Silversea Cruises, among others. Some of them operate as expedition cruises and others only navigate Antarctic waters executing diverse itineraries and variable duration. 
Regarding Ushuaia’s role as a Gateway to Antarctica and the different operation types, several modalities can be identified:
    1) Embarkation and disembarkation in Ushuaia (both passenger changeover operations taking place at the port of Ushuaia).
    2) Embarkation and/or disembarkation in Ushuaia (vessels make only one changeover in Ushuaia, wither on their way to, or on their return from, Antarctica):
        a. Embarkation and/or disembarkation of Antarctic visitors that either embark or disembark at other ports.
        b. Embarkation and/or disembarkation of Antarctic visitors that either embark or disembark in Antarctica connecting with an air service.
    2) In transit (vessels that only call in at the port).
In Table 1 there is a breakdown of the passenger flows by modes of operation at the port of Ushuaia. Column (1) shows a sustained and considerable recovery -close to the 30 %- of operations that take place in Ushuaia as a base port, after the 2008/2009 international economic crisis; while column (2 b) shows a solid increase of flight-cruise operations, modality that includes air service from/to Presidente Frei Station (Isla 25 de Mayo / King George Island) and passenger changeover and the vessel supply in Ushuaia. With regard to vessels only in transit in Ushuaia, a remarkable decrease of visitors can be noted due to the entry into force of the IMO regulation that banned heavy fuel South of the 60º S, and their recovery after the reassignment of vessels to these itineraries.

In conclusion, during the first eight seasons for the on-going decade, 1,640 voyages were made, carrying 276,587 tourists, which represented the 40.27 % of the historic total of voyages and 46.26 % of the total passengers, considering the whole period up to the 2016/2017 season (see Table 2).

Finally, Figure 3 shows the evolution of Antarctic passenger flows and cruise ships operations during the last 25 years of Antarctic tourism. The tourism steady growth from the beginning of the nineties, the expectations for the end of the millennium and its best moment in the first decade of the XXI century, with a visitors’ peak during the 2007/2008 season, are noteworthy. Finally, certain stability was reached in the last seasons after the decrease produced by the banning of use and/or transport of heavy oil in 2011. Further, the increase in the passenger capacity of vessels allows for transporting more visitors in fewer voyages. This stage affirms the consolidation of both Antarctic tourism, as well as the role of Ushuaia as a gateway port.

Final remarks
From the data collected by different government agencies and private-sector initiatives regarding the planning of voyages to Antarctica, as well as the analysis of tourist flows through the port of Ushuaia, a first stage that defined the beginning of Antarctic tourism can be identified, which lasted around 30 years, and in which the Argentine State took part, along with foreign private actors. This period showed a first visitors’ “boom” in the seventies, which later decreased significantly in the eighties, both in the number of voyages as well as visitors.
Starting at the nineties, a new stage took place, one characterised by the consolidation of seaborne Antarctic tourism. There were positive and negative fluctuations that depended both on the activity itself and the development of Ushuaia as a port city. There is no doubt that the improvement of infrastructure and tourism related services in Ushuaia have contributed to consolidate the activity from the nineties. 
Therefore, considering the analyzed period, it can be seen that most of the historical total of visitors (96.37 %) visited Antarctica from the nineties onwards. The beginning of the new century has further concentrated tourist flows which, with diversification of modes of operation and new regulations, reached almost the 90 % of all visitors, demonstrating that the activity is completely consolidated.
Ushuaia, in line with national Argentine initiatives, has accompanied all these stages through which the Antarctic tourist industry has gone by in a proactive way, with clear and sustained influence over its beginning, consolidation and strengthening periods, along more than half a century of tourist activity in the Antarctic continent.
