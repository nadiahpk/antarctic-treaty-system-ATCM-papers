Progress Update on WMO Polar Regional Climate Centres 









Progress Update on WMO Polar Regional Climate Centres 
Background

There is a growing worldwide need for routine, targeted and authoritative climate information to support effective decisions and mitigate risks to people, governments, businesses and the environment, particularly in the polar regions, where such information tends to be sparse. However, up-to-date climate services require appropriate data, computer power, modelling capacities and special expertise, to which not all nations have adequate access. 

It is equally recognized that there is a pronounced deficiency of routine, targeted and authoritative climate information for Antarctic decision makers. This has been highlighted from user engagements and dedicated workshops, such as the:

    • World Meteorological Organisations Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research and Services ( WMO EC-PHORS) survey to COMNAP 2014;
    • Climate Information and Predictive Services (CLIPS) in Polar regions workshop, Russia 2008;
    • Responses from National Meteorological Services (NMSs) to the WMO 2016 survey on interest and ability to participate in Polar Regional Climate Centres; and
    • Council of Managers of Antarctic National Programs (COMNAP) Sea Ice Challenges workshop, Hobart 2015.
 
For example, some of the key findings from the COMNAP Sea Ice workshop include:

    • A call for greater sharing of existing resources and products from those organisations preparing those products in support of their own country’s operations;
    • A call for increased resolution of global-coupled climate models;
    • An interest in knowing if the changes observed in sea ice conditions up to now will continue for a period of time, or whether sea ice challenges are on the decline;
    • A desire for improved understanding of sea ice extent and duration, which allows programs to make smart decisions about when and where to operate and to have confidence in investments related to infrastructure and to any necessary contingencies; and
    • A call for all sea ice scientists engaged in research, monitoring or forecasting in relation to the southern hemisphere to work together, with input from COMNAP where appropriate, to build a global network to produce, inter alia: 
        ◦ An annual report on the scientific consensus on major drivers and trends for patterns of sea ice coverage in the southern hemisphere; and
        ◦ One or two collaborative forecasting and analysis services to cover the entire marine area around the Antarctic continent (noting this would need to be resourced by national operators not from research funding).

WMO recognises this dearth in climate services and, in response, has developed a collaborative and coordinated regionalized approach toward the development of improved climate products and services via Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) and Regional Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs) (refer http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/rcc/rcc.php.)   All six Regional Associations of WMO have committed to the establishment of RCCs; that is: Asia, South West Pacific, Africa, Europe, North and South America. 

RCCs provide online access to their products to member National Meteorological Services (NMSs) so that NMSs can deliver better climate services to national users. Regional and international organizations might also be served by WMO RCCs. RCCs also provide regional data, products and feedback to Global Producing Centres (GPCs) and associated lead centres for respective verification and product optimization of the global-scale information. 

Regional Climate Centres perform regional-scale climate functions, including:

    • Operational Long Range Forecasts (LRF), both dynamical and statistical, within the range of 1 month to 2 year timescale;
    • Climate Monitoring;
    • Coordination between RCCs, Global Producing Centres (GPCs) and National Meteorological Services (NMSs) in the region; 
    • Data services;
    • Climate Applications;
    • Training and capacity building; and 
    • Research and Development.

Engagement between NMSs, RCCs and stakeholder representatives is attained via Regional Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs). Through interaction with sectoral users, extension agencies and policymakers, RCOFs assess the likely implications of the outlooks on the most pertinent socio-economic sectors in a given region, and explore the ways in which use can be made of them.

WMO now prioritises the extension of RCCs and RCOFs in the Polar and high mountain regions of the world. As a first step, WMO focussed on the Arctic Region, where international service coordination was more mature than the Antarctic and Himalayan regions. 
Reporting on the progress of the Arctic RCC

Significant progress has been made in the last year toward the establishment of the Arctic RCC, with structure, national responsibilities and International coordination mechanisms now being agreed on.  A 3-year Arctic RCC demonstration phase is planned to begin in 2017. Examples of the kind of products expected are given in the Appendix. Some key characteristics of the Arctic RCC and RCOF include:

    • The Arctic RCC-Network will consist of three nodes with specific geographical domains of primary responsibility, each of which will perform all mandatory (and some additional high priority) RCC functions for a sub-region: Canada will lead the North American Node (with Canada and USA as members of the consortium); Norway will lead the Northern Europe and Greenland Node (with Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and possibly other interested European countries as members of the consortium); and the Russian Federation will lead the Eurasian Node.
    • Each node will also take on significant cross-node (mandatory) functions for the entire pan-Arctic domain: Canada will lead development of Long-Range Forecasts (LRF); Norway will lead operational Data Services based on WMO Information System requirements; and the Russian Federation will lead Climate Monitoring.
    • The RCC-Network operational entities will adhere to the WMO Policy for the International Exchange of Climate Data and Products.
    • A 3 year demonstration phase will begin in 2017. The first priority in the demonstration phase will be to set up the necessary cooperation and technical processes to ensure that all mandatory functions are fully operational, in order to attain WMO designation as an RCC-Network. 
    • Important shared interests and objectives exist between the Arctic RCC-Network, Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) and the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG). All three will embed the intent to cooperate in their respective Terms of Reference and Implementation Plans. For example, GCW can offer its data portal for access to datasets stored at partner data centres and can assist in assessing the quality of some Arctic RCC products including long range forecasts for Polar Climate Outlook Forums and other model output.
    • Identification of user requirements has been initiated by the EC-PHORS Services Task Team: in addition to hazard identification and risk reduction requirements, high priority sectors that could eventually benefit from Arctic RCC-Network products and services would include the marine, hydrological, natural resources and tourism communities. 
    • Canada is taking steps to host the first Polar Regional Climate Outlook Forum, possibly in autumn 2017, in conjunction with representatives from the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) initiative.

Toward establishing an Antarctic RCC

Antarctica is not part of any WMO Regional Association and has a unique geopolitical status, so considerable effort will be needed to work out the ownership, mandate and governance aspects of an Antarctic RCC and RCOF.  Further, the WMO RCC pathway to improved climate services is via its support and strengthening of National Meteorological Services (NMSs). However, many National Antarctic programs are currently not serviced by their respective homeland NMS, but rather from their Antarctic research teams. A question that arises is whether WMO RCC bolstering of NMSs is an efficient and adequate means of meeting the needs of National Antarctic programs.

WMO is taking steps to develop and propose, in consultation with appropriate partners, a roadmap to implement the Antarctic PRCC Network, whilst learning from the lessons of developing the Arctic PRCC-Network The plan is to organise an Antarctic scoping workshop in 2018, engaging the user, research, and operational communities.  The workshop would explore shared objectives at the technical level and a better understanding of the necessity for and desired form and function of an Antarctic RCC / RCOF.  SCAR, COMNAP, CCAMLR, IICWG, IAATO and interested NMSs and ATCM consultative and non-consultative parties are invited to provide their guidance on:

    • The necessity for an Antarctic RCC/RCOF;
    • Governance aspects relating to development and delivery of climate services including data management, product development and service delivery mechanism;
    • User needs and scope of priority functions; and
    • Member capacities and levels of commitment.

The Antarctic Treaty System places the region in a unique framework of international collaboration that blends well with the borderless nature of atmospheric and ocean processes and the cooperative delivery of climate services. To that end, the WMO invites ATCM consultative and non-consultative parties to become central partners in connecting interested national stakeholders concerned with the establishment of enhanced Antarctic climate services.
Recommendations:

    1. For the ATCM to note the intent of WMO to undertake an Antarctic RCC/RCOF scoping workshop with interested Antarctic stakeholders in 2018;
    2. For ATCM consultative and non-consultative parties to assist WMO in connecting with their National Meteorological Services and National Antarctic programs;
    3. For the ATCM to encourage IAATO, SCAR, CCAMLR and other interested International bodies to engage with WMO in scoping the establishment of an Antarctic RCC and RCOF. 


WMO is committed to a positive, mutually beneficial engagement with Treaty Parties in Antarctic weather and climate services and research.
