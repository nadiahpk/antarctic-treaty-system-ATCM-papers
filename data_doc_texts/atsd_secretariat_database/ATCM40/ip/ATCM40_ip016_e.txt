Representation of Important Bird Areas in the network series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas

Information Paper submitted by New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom
Summary
This Information Paper provides a report (Attachment A) that examined the representation of IBAs in the existing series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), and identified those IBAs that might qualify as “major colonies of breeding native birds”, as requested in Resolution 5 (2015).
Background
Important Bird Areas (IBAs) are defined on the basis of consistent global criteria, developed by BirdLife International, that involve global population assessments combined with available scientific data on colony populations and locations. Criteria for designation as an IBA include that the site contains globally important congregations of birds and/or a significant number of a globally threatened species. 

At the 38th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), Australia, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States presented WP40 and IP27 describing a recently completed analysis that identified 204 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) across Antarctica that met the BirdLife International selection criteria. 

Following the presentation of the papers, the ATCM adopted Resolution 5 (2015) that included the recommendation to: ‘request the Committee for Environmental Protection to provide an update to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting on the extent to which these Important Bird Areas are, or should be, represented within the series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA), in particular those areas that might qualify as “major colonies of breeding native birds”’. 

To address this recommendation, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom commissioned a study to examine the representation of IBAs in the existing series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), and identify those IBAs that might qualify as “major colonies of breeding native birds” (see Attachment A). The study is the first systematic appraisal of Antarctic-wide census data to consider which colonies are, or could be, included within the network of ASPAs (see also ATCM XL WP37).
