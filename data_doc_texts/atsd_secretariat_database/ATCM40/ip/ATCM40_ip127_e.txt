Update on the process of designation of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the West Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Arc of Scotia (Domain 1)

Information paper presented by Argentina and Chile.


The main objective of establishing a system of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the southern oceans is to preserve biodiversity. This is achieved by maintaining a healthy ecosystem, and therefore, specific objectives include the protection of benthic and pelagic hábitats, ecosystemic processes and the feeding and reproduction areas of key marine species. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) views MPAs as conservation tools that complement other already implemented management strategies such as catch limits, restriction of use of certain fishing gear, and closure of specific areas to fishing activities. In this sense, Antarctic marine living resources are protected when they are used in a rational and sustainable manner.

In order to meet its objectives, in 2009 CCAMLR established the first MPA in the southern platform of Southern Orkney Islands, as the first in the Convention area.  In 2011, CCAMLR adopted Conservation Measure 91-04, in which it sets down its intention of developing a representative system of MPA’s in Antarctica so as to ensure the conservation of marine biodiversity in the Convention area, developing the general context for the establishment of MPA’s, that would set the basis for all the proposals presented thereafter. After intense negotiations that lasted over four years, in 2016, CCAMLR finally created the largest MPA in the world, in the Ross Sea region (RSRMPA), thus establishing an important international precedent that once again shows the necessary coexistence of conservation and the rational use of marine resources.

It is in this same context, and in the light of the newly adopted RSRMPA, that Argentina and Chile provide an update to the Committee on the activities carried out to identify priority areas in the West Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Arc of Scotia (Domain 1), activities that they have led since 2012, but that are a result of a multinational effort with multiple contributions of data and experiences, as was described in IP 65 presented to ATCM XXXIX. That paper pointed out the importance of designating MPA’s in the current context of global climate change, given that the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the regions where the effects of global climate change are most evident. Furthermore, the document highlighted the significance of this process, as it integrates, analyzes and presents all available information, contributing to scientific knowledge and providing an exceptional platform for the exchange and visualization of information, thus improving the decision-making process.
 
Presenting an MPA proposal for the West Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Arc of Scotia (Domain 1) constitutes an additional challenge, considering it is the Antarctic region with the most widespread human presence and activities.

As a result, since 2012, three international workshops and one binational workshop aimed at making progress in technical analyses that support the designation of an MPA in Domain 1, have taken place. The last workshop, held in July, 2016, during the Meeting of the Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) led to valuable discussions that motivated research activity with the purpose of i) identifying the most exceptional marine values of Domain 1 that are scarcely represented in other regions; ii) adequately characterizing the dynamics of krill fishing, and iii) identifying the regions with the greatest resilience towards climate change in the next decades.


In this sense, technical progress was focused on:

    • sensitivity analysis to interpret the objects of conservation with the most influence in the identification of priority areas;
    • incorporation of the border area between Domain 1 and 3 as validation of independent analyses;
    • modification of variables associated with critical habitats for mammals and birds to improve their spatial representation;
    • spatial and temporal analyses of fisheries in Domain 1, so as to identify relevant areas, and zones of overlapping between top predators and prey;
    • identification of priority conservation areas west of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Argentina and Chile hope to present a concrete MPA proposal for Domain 1 in the upcoming Meeting of the Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM), which will take place July 10-14, 2017, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

To that effect, Argentina and Chile encourage the Committee to:

    • Support CCAMLR’s activity with regards to the process of designation of MPA’s and, in particular, to note the importance of research activities led by Argentina and Chile, in collaboration with several Parties, with the purpose of identifying priority conservation areas in Domain 1, in the context of the recently designated RSRMPA.
    • Encourage more Parties to collaborate with Argentina and Chile, in particular in regards to achieving a greater understanding of extraction activities in the area, so as to achieve an effective MPA design, where conservation and rational use of resources co-exist.
