ATCM – XL, meeting Beijing, 23 May 2017
Statement by Iceland



Mr. Chairman, dear delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 
Iceland joined the Antarctic Treaty as a non- consultative member in October 2015. The rational for this decision is based on the importance of the scientific work related to oceans, climate change and environmental protection from our side. Now, all the states in the Arctic Council are either consultative or non-consultative members of the Treaty.
Iceland has long standing commitment in its foreign policy to foster cooperation in the scientific field and promote international actions and agreements that contribute to environmental protection, especially when it comes to the marine environment and the oceans. 
In recent decades, the international community has advanced our knowledge about the environment and are now able to base our decisions on policies and management on sound scientific information and data. That knowledge needs to be the basis for our actions, both collectively and individually.
We are pleased to join the group of states that are members to the Antarctic Treaty and thankful for the opportunity to do so, we wholly subscribe to the objective of the Treaty to promote peace and international cooperation in Antarctic region. 
Thank you,
