Liability Annex: Financial Security








Annex VI to the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protocol: Financial Security 
Information Paper submitted by the International Group of P&I Clubs


Background

    1. The International Group of P&I Clubs (IG) welcomes the invitation to the ATCM XL to discuss Annex VI to the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protection and, in particular, the financial security provisions contained therein and the scope of third party liability cover provided by the member P&I Associations of the IG.

    2. The 13 principal underwriting associations comprising the IG provide third party liability insurance cover for approximately 90% of the world’s ocean going tonnage. The insurance cover provided by the Clubs is extensive and includes cover for liabilities of a shipowner arising from ship sourced pollution damage. The Rules on Club cover, that define the scope and terms of cover, are publicly accessible via the websites of each of the 13 Clubs (www.igpandi.org/group-clubs). Although the policy terms that are embodied in each of the Clubs’ Rules are individual to each Club, they differ little between the Clubs.  

    3. The range of liabilities covered by each Club is comprehensive and includes most of the liabilities a ship owner is likely to encounter in the operation of his ship, for example:

    • Pollution liability, including for oil pollution damage,
    • Liability to cargo,
    • Liability to crew,
    • Collision liability,
    • Liabilities for loss of, damage to or interference with the rights in relation to any fixed or moveable property above in or below land or water,
    • Liability for wreck removal.

    4. The P&I cover provided by the IG Clubs underpins the liability and compensation regime established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for ship-sourced pollution damage, with specific reference to the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage that are currently in force in 136 and 83 States respectively. 

    5. Many of the vessels operating in Antarctic waters maintain P&I cover with a member P&I Club of the IG.
Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protocol: Financial Security 
    6. Whilst Annex VI is not yet in force, it has been considered by the IG given the scope of P&I cover and the fact that the IG attended ATCM XXVIII in Stockholm in June 2005 as an invited observer with the delegation of IAATO.

    7. The IG’s interest therefore stems from the liability cover provided by the IG P&I Clubs and the liability and compulsory insurance provisions contained in Annex VI.  In this regard, the IG notes that Annex VI applies to “environmental emergencies” and that these are defined as accidental events that result in, or imminently threaten to result in, any significant and harmful impact on the Antarctic environment. 

    8. The IG understands that there are essentially three aspects of obligations and liability under Annex VI, reflecting those outlined in the Protocol itself: 1) the prevention and mitigation of environmental emergencies 2) responding to such emergencies, and 3) assigning liability for meeting the costs of responding, with the focus on assigning liability for meeting the costs of responding.

    9. Article 6 of the Annex makes an operator that fails to take the required response action strictly liable for the costs of actions taken by any Parties. When a State operator should have taken prompt and effective response action but failed to do so, and no response action was taken by any Party, the State operator shall be liable to pay the costs of the response action which should have been undertaken into a fund administered by the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty. When a non-State operator who should have taken the response action failed to do so, and no response action was taken by any Party, the non-State operator is liable to pay an amount of money that reflects as much as possible the costs of the response action that should have been taken, into the Fund, or alternatively, to the Party of the operator or to the Party taking enforcement action against it under Article 7(3) of the Annex. 

    10. From an insurance perspective, the IG notes that Parties must require their operators to maintain adequate insurance or other financial security up to the applicable limits contained in the Annex to cover their liability to Parties who step in to take the required response actions where they have themselves failed to do so. Parties can also require similar financial security to be provided to cover circumstances where the operator is liable to make a payment to the Fund, to the Party of the non-State operator or to a party that takes enforcement action against it in circumstances where no Party steps in to address the emergency.

    11. The IG notes that the operator may limit their liability in accordance with the limits contained in the Annex, and that these limits are identical to the property damage limits contained in the Protocol of 1996 to Amend the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (at the point the Protocol was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)).  The Annex will not affect the liability or the right to limit liability under any applicable international limitation of liability treaty, or the application of a reservation made under any such treaty to exclude the application of the limits therein for certain claims.

    12. As noted, all IG Clubs provide, inter alia, third party liability cover for ship sourced pollution damage, with the Clubs’ pollution damage rule covering the liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses when and to the extent that they are caused by or incurred in consequence of the discharge or escape from an entered ship of oil or any other substance or the threat of such discharge or escape.  

    13. In light of the above, the IG notes the following:

    • That the insurance provided by the IG Clubs would, in principle, cover the liabilities of a commercial operator (being a shipowner) as prescribed in Article 6 of the Annex;

    • In that regard, it should be noted that the IG Clubs provide such cover to their shipowner entered Members.  The definition of “operator” in Article 2 (c) of the Annex is however much wider and encompasses “any natural or judicial person, whether governmental or non-governmental, which organises activities to be carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area”. Such a definition may encompass parties other than the shipowner and may, therefore, include parties that will not have P&I cover with an IG Club.  The IG makes this observation given that the insurance provision contained in Article 11 of the Annex requires those parties that fall within the definition of “operator” to maintain adequate insurance or other financial security.

    • That the existing certificates of insurance (known as certificates of entry) that are issued by the IG Clubs to all ships entered for P&I cover should be sufficient evidence that a ship has insurance in place that meets the requirements of Annex VI (all 13 IG Clubs have publicly accessible on-line search facilities that allow any party to ascertain whether a ship has P&I cover with that particular IG Club: http://new.igpandi.org/ship-search-links);

    • On the basis that the compulsory insurance provision does not provide for a right of action directly against the insurance provider, nor a requirement that insurers waive policy defences contained in the Clubs’ Rules, the IG understands that insurers will be able to invoke defences contained in Club Rules as well as the defences available to the insured in Article 8 of the Annex;

    • The limits contained in Article 9 of the Annex appear to represent a minimum requirement.  If this is correct, then in a jurisdiction where lower limits (e.g. the 1976 LLMC Convention) are applicable, the lower limits will be superseded by the Annex VI limits and in a jurisdiction where higher limits (e.g. the 1996 LLMC Protocol as amended in 2012) are applicable, such higher limits will prevail;

    • It is unclear how Article 9 (2) of the Annex will operate.  The article provides that the Annex shall not affect the liability or right to limit liability under any applicable international limitation of liability treaty.  Presumably, this primarily means the existing LLMC regimes that are in force.  However, the LLMC regimes do not contain their own jurisdiction clauses.  

    • Whilst Article 7 of the Annex seeks to address where actions may be commenced against the relevant operator it is also unclear how this dovetails with Article 9 (2) of the Annex and the LLMC regime.  For example, does the reference in Article 9 (2) to an operator’s “liability or right to limit liability” refer to such a right that exists in the Party that took response action, or where the operator is incorporated or has its principal place of business or is habitually resident, or does it mean the “Party of that Operator” as per Article 2 (d) of the Annex?

    • The IG notes that Article 12 of the Annex provides that payments into the fund shall provide “inter alia, for the reimbursement of the reasonable and justified costs incurred” and that parties may make proposals to the ATCM for reimbursement to be paid from the fund.  It is unclear exactly what such reimbursements could be used for, since they are not restricted in Article 12 (1) to covering the costs incurred by a Party. For example, could they be used to fund the establishment of response equipment and resources in Antarctica?  How will “reasonable and justified costs” be assessed?

 
    14. The International Group welcomes discussion on the above.
