Introduction
At CEP XIX, the Committee nominated a representative from the United Kingdom to act as the CEP Observer at the XXXIV SCAR Delegates Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (29-30 August 2016). The SCAR Delegates Meeting was attended by Delegates from 30 countries, Associate Members from seven countries, six Union Members, and representatives of the 15 SCAR Subsidiary Groups.  A total of 59 Working Papers and 19 Information Papers were presented and discussed during the course of the meeting. The documents presented and discussed during the meeting and the final meeting report are available from the SCAR website (see: http://www.scar.org/meetings/)
The SCAR Delegates Meeting was chaired by Prof. Jerónimo López-Martínez, and commenced following the conclusion of the SCAR Open Science Conference.
Aspects of the meeting of particular relevance to the CEP
During this meeting, four new countries (Colombia, Austria, Thailand and Turkey) joined SCAR as Associate Members and confirmed their commitment to the development of Antarctic research. 
Prof. Steven Chown (Australia) was elected as President and Prof. Dr. K. Lochte (Germany) was re-elected as Vice President. Prof. J. Simões from Brazil was elected as a new Vice President. They joined Prof. Azizan Abu Samah (Malaysia) and Prof. Terry Wilson (USA), the current Vice Presidents. Prof. Jerónimo López-Martínez (Spain) began a two-year term as Immediate Past President.
Dr. Aleks Terauds reported on the progress and plans of the SCAR Standing Committee on the Antarctic Treaty System (SCATS), including interactions with the Treaty and the CEP and the future of the Antarctic Environments Portal (www.environments.aq). SCATS has continued to engage in a diverse range of international activities that enhance SCAR’s reputation as a provider of independent, scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System and as a leader in Antarctic science, i.e. (1) the development and participation in the Monaco Assessment meeting and associated outputs, (2) the development of the Antarctic Conservation Strategy for the 21st Century, (3) maintaining a key role in the Antarctic Environments Portal, and (4) direct involvement in a diverse range of research projects.  The following SCAR agreements and/or commitments were reported:
    • SCAR will continue to play an active role in supporting the Antarctic Environments Portal project, in particular through the provision of editorial and review services (coordinated through SCATS) and the development of content.
    • SCAR will continue to provide updates to the Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment Reports, and consider the inclusion of a high level synthesis of the information in these updates
    • SCAR will bring a selection of previous Codes of Conduct to CEP XX (2017) for consideration for endorsement by means of resolution
    • SCAR will provide a report on the findings of the Monaco Assessment meeting held in 2015 to CEP XX (2017)
    • SCAR will prepare a summary of the current state of knowledge, including any advances in research, regarding the impacts of UAVs on wildlife for CEP XX (2017) (agreed 2015, confirmed 2016)
    • SCAR will provide a report to CEP XX (2017) on research and monitoring activities that are being undertaken that are of relevance to the CEP Climate Change Work Response Programme (CCWRP)
    • SCAR will provide an update on the current state of knowledge of the impact of underwater noise on marine biota to CEP XXI (2017)
    • SCAR will provide the final report on Southern Ocean Acidification to CEP XXI (2017)
    • The ATCM once again, invited SCAR to give a lecture on scientific issues relevant to ATCM XL
    • SCAR will provide a proposal about the conservation of Antarctic geological and geomorphological values, including fossils, to CEP XXI (2018)

SCAR Delegates approved the principle of SCAR taking over operational management of the Antarctic Environments Portal after June 2018, on the basis of external funding being found to support the project.
Next meeting
The next SCAR Delegates’ Meeting will be held in Davos, Switzerland, in June 2018.
