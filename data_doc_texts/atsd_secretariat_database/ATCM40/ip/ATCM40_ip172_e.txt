Cooperation of Romania with Australia, China, India and Russian
Federation within ASMA No. 6 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica
Cooperation of Romania with Australia, China, India and Russian
Federation within ASMA No. 6 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by Romania
Summary
This paper gives a brief report on the Romanian cooperation with
Australia, China, India and Russian Federation in the Larsemann
Hills area, East Antarctica. The paper also states the willingness of
Romania to continue this scientific, logistical and environmental
cooperation with these Parties in the Management Group of
Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 6 Larsemann Hills.
Introduction
Romania participated, in 2006 and 2007, along with Australia,
China, India and Russian Federation in the elaboration of the
Management Plan based on which the Antarctic Specially Managed
Area (ASMA) No. 6 Larsemann Hills was designated under Measure
2 (2007), following a proposal by Australia, China, India, Romania
and the Russian Federation. Romania became a member in this
ASMA 6 Management Group as an operator, along with Australia, of
the Law Base in East Antarctica, based on the “Memorandum of
Understanding concerning the Joint Use of Law Base at Larsemann
Hills, Prydz Bay, East Antarctica”, between the Australian Antarctic
Division and the Romanian Antarctic Foundation, signed on June
15th, 2005 and valid for ten years (2005-2015). During 2007-2012,
Romania elaborated along with the other states in the ASMA 6
Management Group the respective annual “Report of the Larsemann
Hills Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management
Group”1.
Romanian activities in Larsemann Hills area
Romania conducted expedition activities of scientific exploration
and research in Antarctica since 1998, within certain cooperation
with the Russian Federation (the Russian Expeditions in Antarctica
1998 and 2007), China (CHINARE 2002-2003 and 2005-2006) and
Australia (at the Law-Racovita Base in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007).
Since June 15, 2005, due to the Memorandum of Understanding
concluded and signed between Australia and Romania for a period
of ten years, Romanian researchers benefited from the access to the
Law Base in Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica.
The Law Base, by this memorandum was denominated Law-
Racovita, in honour of the first explorer of Larsemann Hills area
(1958), the Australian scientist Phillip Garth Law (1912-2010) and
of the first biologist in the world that studied life in Antarctica
within Belgica Expedition (1897-1899), the Romanian Emil
Racovita (1868-1947). The Law-Racovita Base was inaugurated on
February 20, 2006, in the presence of the representatives of the
Member States in the area (Australia, China and Russian
Federation).
Research carried out at Law-Racovita Base within such cooperation,
led to the development of some Romanian scientific projects
dedicated to the International Polar Year IPY 2007-2008, financed
by the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research and the
Romanian Academy, involving Romanian researchers and 10
foreign partners. In 2009, an international team (Australia, Austria,
Estonia and India) worked in Larsemann Hills for an inter-
hemisphere, Joint Project of 13 states, coordinated by Romania
(Project Manager - Eng. Teodor Gheorghe Negoita, Ph. D, the
Leader of the Law-Racovita Base at that moment). The base was
redenominated, on December 9, 2011, Law-Racovita-Negoita, in
recognition of the contribution of Dr. Negoita (1946-2011) to the
progress of Antarctic sciences. This base name was valid until
June15th 2015, when the a.m. Australian-Romanian Memorandum
of Understanding expired.

The representative scientific organism of Romania in the Antarctic
Treaty System is, since 2012, the National Commission for Antarctic
Research (NCAR) within the Romanian Academy. Some NCAR
members were previously involved in activities of scientific research
in Larsemann Hills and environmental activities related to the
Management Group of Larsemann Hills ASMA 6, along with
Australia, China, India and Russia. NCAR elaborated the Romanian
Antarctic Science Strategic Plan 2013-2020, that was communicated
within ATCM XXXVI, 2013, Agenda item 13, by IP 071 rev.1.
The Romanian Strategic Plan for Antarctic Research 2013-2020 was
structured considering four main research themes:
Theme 1. Antarctic ecosystems: biodiversity and vulnerability,
preservation and bioprospecting
Theme 2. Cryo-geo-climatic Processes in the Antarctic System
Theme 3. Antarctica as a platform of astronomical, astrophysical
and climate observations
Theme 4. Frontier Science: Antarctica as analogous space
National Commission for Antarctic Research of the Romanian
Academy intends, as previously communicated within ATCM
XXXVII, 2014 by IP 98 (Agenda item CEP 9f), to resume its
activities in Antarctica as an active Party in the Management Group
of ASMA 6 Larsemann Hills. Romanian activities will be performed
in accordance with the four research themes of the Strategic Plan
for Antarctic Research 2013-2020 established by NCAR in relation
to the SCAR Programs. To implement the Strategic Plan for
Antarctic Research, the Romanian Ministry of Education and
Research founded the Arctic and Antarctic Research Department
within the National Institute of R&D for Biological Sciences,
Bucharest.
Romanian Academy, the National Antarctic Operator by its NCAR,
took steps to conclude a new scientific cooperation agreement with
the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), that would enable
Romanian researchers the access to the Law Base in Larsemann
Hills. Discussions of the Romanian and Australian delegates to
ATCM XXXVI, Brussels, 2013, ATCM XXXVIII, Sofia, 2015 and
ATCM XXXIX, Santiago, Chile, 2016, as well as the documents
exchanged between Romanian Academy and AAD revealed, in
2015-2016, the possibility of signing a scientific cooperation
agreement, based on the common interest scientific fields and
research themes stipulated in the Australian and Romanian
Antarctic Strategic Plans, respectively. Romania (NCAR)
communicated at ATCM XXXIX, 2016, a list of eleven research
projects proposed by Romania to be developed in Larsemann Hills
area in the next 5 years, in cooperation with Australia and the other
Parties in ASMA 6. (ATCM XXXIX, Agenda item 15, IP 125 rev.1 -
Prospectives of Romania cooperation with Australia in Antarctica,
including the “List of Romanian Proposals for the cooperation with
Australia in Antarctica, in the common interest scientific fields”).
NCAR is developing its Group of expedition operational planning,
logistical and strategic planning.
Conclusion
Romania, as previously communicated, reaffirms its willingness to
resume its activity of scientific research in cooperation in the ASMA
6 Larsemann Hills area, for the following five years, and implicitly
to reactivate its position in the ASMA No. 6 Management Group.
