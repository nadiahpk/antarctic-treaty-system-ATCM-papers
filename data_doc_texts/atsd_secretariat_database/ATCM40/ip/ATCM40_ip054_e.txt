Detection and eradication of a non-native Collembola incursion in a hydroponics facility in East Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
This paper describes a successful response to an incursion of non-native invertebrates in a hydroponics facility at Australia’s Davis station, conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines to minimise the risks of non-native species and disease associated with Antarctic hydroponics facilities endorsed by CEP XV (2012).
Background
The Australian Antarctic program has operated hydroponic facilities since the 1970s to provide fresh vegetables to supplement frozen and fresh produce imported during the annual station resupply, and to contribute to the health, morale and psychological wellbeing of station personnel. The hydroponics facilities are managed in accordance with standard operating procedures, which are maintained as controlled documents in accordance with the Australian Antarctic Division’s certified Environmental Management System (EMS). Measures to address biosecurity risks include use of sterilised seed, an annual shut down and clean, sterilization and incineration of all waste, and procedures for reporting and rapidly responding to any incursions of non-native species or disease within the facility. 
The event and the response
In May 2014, a non-native incursion of the collembola, Xenylla sp. was found within the hydroponics facility (two sea containers specially modified for hydroponics use) at Australia’s Davis station, in the Vestfold Hills region of East Antarctica. Station personnel undertaking periodic monitoring in the hydroponics facility found small invertebrates within and on the surface of water in hydroponic containers. On-site examination identified the invertebrates as collembola from the Hypogasturidae family. In response to an on-line Environmental Incident Report lodged using the Australian Antarctic Division’s Incidents, Hazards and Improvement Suggestions (IHIS) system, an expert group was formed immediately to provide advice (see examples in Fig. 1.) and to develop a response plan. By examining the results of previous research and the terrestrial Antarctic Biodiversity Database (http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/biodiversity/), which indicated that springtails had not been recorded in the region previously, the expert group concluded that it was highly likely that the collembola were non-native.
A rapid response was enacted to eradicate the incursion. Station personnel closed, stripped and cleaned the facility according to AAD hydroponics standard operating procedures and the Guidelines to minimise the risks of non-native species and disease associated with Antarctic hydroponics facilities endorsed by CEP XV (2012) (http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/att/ATCM35_att103_e.doc). This involved localised insecticide use and incineration of all plants and growing media. The expert group then advised a course of action to kill any remaining animals or eggs. This involved a sequence of shutting down the facility to ambient temperatures (mean -11.5oC) and then reheating to growing temperatures (approximately 10°C) for a week then refreezing. The aim was to encourage any remaining eggs to hatch followed by freezing to kill any hatchlings. The reheating also included heating the ground under the facility (Fig. 2) in case any collembolla had been transported out of the facility on footwear. This cycle was repeated three times in sequence. Furthermore, in November 2014, the hydroponic facility was sprayed inside and out with 70% ethanol.  Ethanol was chosen because it was available on site, is known to kill collembola rapidly, and it evaporates quickly, leaving no residue in the environment.  The hydroponic facility was then removed from the site onto sea ice and then transported back to Australia via ship. The soil directly underlying the infrastructure was also treated with 70% ethanol. 
Two consecutive years of monitoring have not detected collembola in station buildings or in the surrounding environment. Monitoring will continue into the future to confirm eradication. 
Discussion
This case potentially represents the first successful eradication of a non-native microarthropod in Antarctica. Key observations and conclusions include:
    • In this instance the last barrier to non-native species introduction – regular surveillance – resulted in early detection and rapid response, which illustrates the importance of taking a multiple barrier approach to addressing non-native species risks.
    • The use of an online incident reporting system ensured prompt reporting of the incident, and facilitated efficient communication between relevant experts and the expeditioners on site, and a rapid response.
    • A process of continual improvement in managing non-native species risks is important. Following this experience:
    • further mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Australian Antarctic Division’s procedures for managing hydroponics facilities;
    • this incident is used as an example in training for all station personnel in the use of hydroponics facilities, with particular emphasis placed on the significance of identifying and rapidly reporting non-native species incursions (including through a new online training module);
    • standard operating procedures have been updated to reinforce the importance of weekly surveillance checks and the use of disinfection mats and insect traps within the facility;
    • the new hydroponics facility installed at Davis station was designed to give additional attention to biosecurity, utilising a single growing method and growth media, and including a more open design that allows for easier surveillance of plants and cleaning;
    • the potential pathways for the introduction of the collembola to the hydroponics facility were examined, and the growing media (fibrous material derived from natural products shipped in plastic bags with small perforations for aeration) was identified as the most likely source. As a result fibrous material is no longer used in Australian Antarctic hydroponic systems, and has been replaced with kiln-fired ceramic beads; and
    • the advanced waste water treatment plant to be installed at Davis station will also address any risks associated with the release of invertebrates, fungal spores or microorganisms in waste water from the hydroponic facility (see ATCM XXXIX/BP8).
Details of the incursion have been submitted to the Aliens Database maintained by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/biodiversity/index_aliens.cfm), which the CEP has endorsed as the central repository for records of non-native species occurrences in the Antarctic region. 
Figure 1.  Examples of advice from the expert group given via the IHIS reporting system.
    • “Infestations are covered in the hydroponics manual. 2.2 covers insect management.”
    • “Strict quarantine protocols would need to be in place for disposal (incineration of material) and handling of waste water, as collembola can be transported in water.”
    • “Everything needs to be cleaned in situ before it is removed. It is really easy to transport springtails, or their eggs and we need to minimise the chance of that happening. Also be aware that eggs can be in soil and gravel (or any other substrate) so everything needs to be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly. “
    • “It's really important that we get as many individuals as possible preserved in ethanol for return to Australia. If we can find out what they are we have a much better chance of working out where they came from and therefore developing a plan to make sure that they aren't introduced again.” 
    • “Springtails need moisture so to treat / clean the hydroponics room once everything is out of there, making the room as dry as possible would be a good way of ensuring that all eggs and adults die. Of course all plant and potting media should be at least double bagged inside the building prior to incineration. If there was cans of insecticide I would suggest spraying the exterior of each bag before taking it outside.”
