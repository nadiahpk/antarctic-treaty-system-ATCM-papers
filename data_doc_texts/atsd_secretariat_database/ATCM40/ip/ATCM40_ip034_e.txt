Workshop on Environmental Assessment of the McMurdo Dry Valleys: Witness to the Past and Guide to the Future
Information Paper submitted by the United States
Introduction
The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) in southern Victoria Land make up the largest ice-free expanse in Antarctica.  The MDV is made up of a connected system of glaciers, hyperarid soils, streams, and lakes, which support a fragile ecosystem.  The geomorphology of the area has changed little over the past three million years, providing us with a unique glimpse into the past that can be used to guide us into the future.  The biological systems within the MDV are relatively simple, yet complex interactions among species occur within and between glaciers, brines, streams, soils, and lakes.  The MDV is a unique place which contains some of the most extreme ecosystems on earth in regards to temperature, light, and water availability.  These factors mean that the MDV is both an extremely valuable natural laboratory in which adaptation and evolution can be understood, and an environment where small changes can produce a cascade of ecological consequences.  Within the past several decades, research, research support activities, and tourism have increased in the MDV.  In 1999, an international workshop focused on the human impacts in the region and the scientific community agreed that it was again time to examine the impact of human activities on both the environment and the science within the Dry Valleys.  An international workshop was convened from 2-4 May 2016 to outline documented and potential human impacts in the area, determine the efficacy of current management in the MDV, and develop recommendations for management of future research and tourist activities in the region.
History of Human Impact
The first people to enter the MDV were Captain Robert Falcon Scott and two companions in 1903.  In 1911 a party led by Griffith Taylor produced sketches, photographs, and descriptions of what is now Taylor Valley.  The environmental impact of the visits during the ‘heroic era’ was minimal.  Following the 1911 expedition, the MDV was next studied by the United States and New Zealand during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), marking the beginning of the modern era of scientific research in the MDV.  Since the IGY, scientists have visited the MDV every year.  Despite patchy records on the trends in human activities over time in the MDV, it is clear that activity has increased in the past 30 years.  The establishment of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) site in 1992 further increased the number of camps, researchers, and support contractors working in the MDV.  There has also been increasing visitor interest in the MDV with recent requests that the MDV Management Group consider establishing additional visitor sites within the ASMA.  Although there is now a long record of continuous scientific study of the MDV, there has been no systematic collection and analysis of data on human impacts.  While inconsistent records exist on parameters relating to human presence and impact, the available data have not yet been consolidated by each National Antarctic Program (NAP) operating in the MDV.  Further, an integrated collection of human impact data from all NAPs operating in the MDV has yet to be achieved.
Future Environmental Challenges
There has long been an awareness of the potential for human activity to impact the MDV and the first specially protected area in the MDV was designated in 1975 (ASPA 123 Barwick and Balham Valleys).  Following the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991 the MDV ASMA (ASMA No. 2) was designated in 2004.  The environmental challenges facing the MDV are constantly changing in the face of technology developments, climate change, and the nature of human activity.  Participants identified issues of future concern including:

Remotely and Autonomously Operated Vehicles
Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomously Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming more affordable, and more scientifically capable.  AUVs have the capacity to perform tasks that would otherwise require SCUBA divers, reducing human risk and potentially lowering environmental impact.  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are lightweight, inexpensive tools that can assist in spatial mapping and environmental monitoring.  However, there are concerns about privacy, use in restricted airspace, interference with scientific work, and potential impacts if lost which need to be addressed through the development of guidelines for their use.
Non-Native Species
Non-native species are yet to be documented in the MDV because the extent of biodiversity in the region remains largely unknown.  The MDV ecosystem is dominated by microorganisms and the current distribution of taxa across habitats in the MDV is highly variable.  Non-native microorganisms have the potential to alter ecosystem function and community structure.  Microbial invasions can be exacerbated by global change and human disturbance.  Climate change combined with increased human movement can result in dispersal of non-indigenous taxa from outside of the continent and between ecoregions in Antarctica.
Additional issues of future concern identified by workshop participants include the environmental impact that may arise from extended season research.  Increases in the temporal coverage of field camps requires additional resources and more fuel to support, increasing the overall human impact in the MDV.  Fossil fuel use has an impact on environmental quality through non-gaseous carbon and nitrogen fluxes which could be significant over long-term time scales.  
The overall human footprint in the MDV is difficult to discern due in part to the large geographical distribution and diversity of groups visiting the valleys.  Additionally, variation in the substrate type within the MDV make it difficult to accurately determine the past presence of human activity.  Tourist visits to the MDV are restricted to one site in the Taylor Valley which is subject to Treaty approved site guidelines.  The cumulative impacts of science and tourism activities in the MDV is a concern as a single environmental disturbance can cause a cascade of unanticipated consequences.  The increase in person-days within the MDV associated with extended research will increase; the use of fossil fuels, the risk of spills, and the risk of non-native species introductions over time.  
Environmental Management Framework
A proposed framework was developed by the workshop participants for an expanded ASMA management plan that would cover the state of the current environment, the pressures on the environment from direct human activities and from global change, and more detailed management responses to those pressures.  This plan requires an adaptive management approach, responsive to current knowledge of the state of the environment as affected by current and emerging pressures.  The proposed management framework would provide a feedback mechanism which takes into account the changes in the environment caused by human impacts and global change, allowing management procedures to be altered accordingly.  There is an urgent need to address concerns over the accelerating environmental pressures on the MDV ecosystems.  Given the decreasing availability of near pristine environments, there is concern for further spatial protection of the area.
Recommendations from the Workshop
Workshop attendees formulated recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the ASMA and ASPAs so as to preserve the unique values of the MDV region, including:
    • NAPs operating in the ASMA should move towards a management strategy that recognizes the impact of global change when developing and implementing environmental protocols.  The management strategy should be based on best available scientific evidence.  
    • NAPs have been collecting human activity data in the MDV for decades, however little is available to managers and scientists.  It is important that collaboration is enhanced among the programs operating in the ASMA to track field sites, camp locations, landing sites, personnel movements, and environmental incidents.  This information should be integrated into a publically available GIS-based system.  
    • Field activity data should be collected routinely and made accessible to inform management decisions and future science planning.  Stakeholders should invest in technology to facilitate consistent documentation, streamlined analysis, and presentation of field activities.
    • NAPs should invest in research that integrates scientific evidence with management strategies.  This integration can be used to determine intrinsically sensitive landscape components.  Information should include areas of high priority for conservation and restoration, habitats at elevated risk of biological invasion, suitable tourism locations, and projected vulnerability to climate change.  
    • NAPs should synthesize all human activity data to assess the environmental footprint of current scientific, logistic, and tourism activities to guide future development of management policies.
    • Parties operating in the MDV should be consistent in adopting the environmental guidelines in the ASMA management plan to safeguard against the introduction of non-native species.  Practices could include cleaning boots and equipment between field sites, using MDV dedicated equipment, and identifying higher-risk personnel, equipment, and activities.
    • NAPs should facilitate research activities that enhance the management and protection of the ASMA, including supporting future monitoring programs that evaluate the effectiveness of the ASMA management plan.  
    • NAPs and stakeholders should hold workshops to assess environmental management of the ASMA at regular five year intervals on a rotational basis.
    • NAPs should consult available and relevant scientific personnel in response to environmental incidents.
    • NAPs should charge education and outreach programs to address issues such as the environmental sensitivity of the ecosystem, the role of the MDV as sentinels of global environmental change, and the importance of environmental stewardship in all aspects of work in the area.
Conclusion
It is clear that with increasing human activities in the MDV, a robust and responsive management strategy that takes advantage of human impact data is necessary.  The information on human impacts gained through collaboration among NAPs should be used to shape future management and protection actions within the ASMA.
