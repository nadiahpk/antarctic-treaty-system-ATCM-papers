Australian Antarctic Science Program: highlights of the 2016/17 season
Information paper submitted by Australia
Introduction
The Australian Antarctic Science Program conducts research guided by the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan 2011-12 to 2020-21. In 2016/171 the program undertook 86 science projects involving around 120 scientists and support personnel in Antarctica and the subantarctic, drawn from 150 institutions across 21 countries. The program continues to benefit enormously from these national and international collaborations.
The Australian Antarctic Science Program has a strong strategic focus by undertaking research designed to inform Australia’s environmental policy and conservation management, and to make contributions to regional and global issues through international bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).
Public summaries of all projects, past and present, undertaken by the Australian Antarctic Science Program are available on the Australian Antarctic Division website.
Selected research highlights from the 2016/17 season
The 2016/17 Australian Antarctic Science Program has delivered projects aligning with the four themes identified in the Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan 2011-12 to 2020-21:
	Theme 1: Climate Processes and Change
	Theme 2: Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems: Environmental Change and Conservation
	Theme 3: Southern Ocean Ecosystems: Environmental Change and Conservation
	Theme 4: Frontier Science
Projects under the Climate Processes and Change focussed on the Antarctic ice sheet, oceans and marine ice in the Southern Hemisphere, atmospheric processes and change, and Antarctic paleoclimate. These projects are each contributing to our understanding of the role of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the global climate system. Of particular note:
    • The ICECAP II (International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling) project is a collaboration between the Australian Antarctic Division and the University of Texas. This project is exploring the structure of the Antarctic ice sheet from the air to answer key questions about its contribution to current and future sea-level rise, and to assist with the identification of a site for a million year ice core. 2016/17 was the 8th successful season of this project. 
    • The ‘Ocean Forced Evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet’ project undertook aerial field work at the Totten Glacier to collect oceanographic and glaciological observations. This project brings together researchers from eight countries to determine key processes controlling ice shelves and how Antarctic ice flows into the oceans, and will inform an assessment of the scale of possible future sea level change.
    • The 2016/17 season saw the collection of new field data on bedrock uplift and ice thickness change over time to improve estimates of East Antarctic ice sheet and glacial isostatic adjustment. This collaboration between researchers from Australia and the United Kingdom, will improve estimates of the contribution made by East Antarctica to present and past sea-level changes. 
    • Seismic surveys were undertaken and monitoring equipment installed on the Sørsdal Glacier to make detailed observations, of ice flow response to the formation of surface meltwater, changes in sea ice conditions and rifting/calving and melting at the ice-ocean contact. This project is a collaboration between scientists from Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand and will improve understanding of how these processes affect the flow of ice to improve computational models of ice sheets and projections of sea level rise. 
    • The Aurora Australis undertook a marine science voyage to the Totten Glacier and Mertz Glacier regions, and completed observations for the southern end of a key transect between Tasmania and Antarctica (the SR3 transect). Ice conditions prevented a return to previously visited regions of the Totten Glacier ice front and large areas in the Mertz region, however the ship was able to get close to the Ninnis Glacier for the first time, confirming the existence of a deep trough. Sampling was conducted in the Dalton, Mertz and Ninnis polynyas and along the Moscow University ice shelf.  
    • The Australia-China Ozone Research Nexus (ACORN) project deployed balloon-borne ozone sensors near Davis Research Station. This project is contributing to global monitoring of the long-term behaviour of ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. 
Theme 2, Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems this year included a range of projects examining trends and sensitivity to change, vulnerability and spatial protection, and the prevention, mitigation and remediation of human impacts. These projects focus on investigating the effects of environmental change on Antarctic and subantarctic ecosystems and on providing the scientific basis to guide enhanced environmental protection. In 2016/17 these projects included:
    • Subantarctic research at Macquarie Island on Azorella cushion plant conservation, post pest eradication ecosystem response, and weed control and eradication. This research may inform efforts to develop effective responses to non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.
    • The remediation of petroleum contaminants including the first use of remediated materials in building footings at Casey Research Station and the continued use and development of biopile techniques for the remediation of contaminated soil. Research is also continuing into the residual toxicity of sites subject to fuel contamination and undergoing soil remediation, and includes research partnerships with Canadian researchers. 
Marine ecosystem change and wildlife conservation are key features of the Southern Oceans Ecosystems Theme. This research is critical to understanding the impact of global change on Southern Ocean ecosystems and the effective conservation of Antarctic and Southern Ocean wildlife. In addition to science undertaken directly in support of Australia’s contributions to key forums including CCAMLR, several marine science and monitoring projects were undertaken in 2016/17, including: 
    • The final field season for the Antarctic Free Ocean Carbon Enrichment (antFOCE) project near Casey Research Station. This year saw the retrieval of the data logger that has been recording the acidity, oxygen, salinity and temperature of the seawater since the 2015/16 season. Footage taken at the site by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) recorded the productive, colourful, and dynamic habitat, with a diverse range of sponges, sea spiders, urchins, sea cucumbers and sea stars. 
    • Continuing programs to investigate seabird responses to change through the deployment (and subsequent retrieval) of satellite tracking devices on snow petrels, Cape petrels and departing female Adelie penguins as well as through camera monitoring and seabird surveys.
    • Ongoing monitoring projects including penguin monitoring at Bechervaise Island (near Mawson Research Station) as part of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program, seabird monitoring (including winter Emperor penguin counts), and albatross and giant petrel monitoring at Macquarie Island.
    • Marine science projects to investigate planktonic food webs, the impacts of sea ice change, and to characterise seabed habitats, as well as baleen whale habitat utilisation.
    • An experimental krill research program working with key international collaborators including Japan. This year the Australian Antarctic Division was able to utilise its expanded air transport capability to, for the first time, transport live krill, collected near Casey Research Station by Aurora Australis, to Australia for holding and research at the Australian Antarctic Division’s krill aquarium. 
The Frontier Science Theme has continued to deliver high value scientific research. In 2016/17 these included projects investigating space weather, aquatic microbial interactions, and an ongoing study in partnership with Michigan State University into team effectiveness and team cohesion. 
The 2016/17 season has been highly successful for the Australian Antarctic Science Program. It has seen the continuation of a number of multiyear projects and field work in the vicinity of each of Australia’s Antarctic research stations and beyond. International scientific collaboration and logistics cooperation continue to support the success of the Australian Antarctic Science Program. 
The Australian Antarctic Science Strategic Plan is currently under review. Australia welcomes the views and input of our collaborative partners including Treaty Parties in this review process.
