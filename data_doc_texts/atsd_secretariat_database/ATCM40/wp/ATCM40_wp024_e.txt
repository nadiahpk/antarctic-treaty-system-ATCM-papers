Background
After recognizing the need for better public and educational outreach activities regarding Antarctica during ATCM XXXVII in Brasilia, an ICG on Education and outreach was established during ATCM XXXVIII in Sofia. At the same ATCM, a very successful workshop on Education and Outreach was held: ninety seven participants from thirty seven parties, observers and experts took part in the workshop.  During ATCM XXXIX in Santiago, Bulgaria introduced WP 24 First Report on the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach, jointly prepared with Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and the United Kingdom.  The ATCM recognised the contribution of parties and the usefulness of the ICG’s work. Parties were advised to continue to use and promote the forum on Education and Outreach to share information on Education and Outreach activities and events with each other. Contributions to Education and Outreach activities from an Antarctic Treaty Perspective remains within the Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan of the ATCM. 
As stated in the final report of ATCM XXXIX in Santiago, paragraph 148, the Meeting agreed to continue the ICG on Education and Outreach for another intersessional period, and agreed to the following terms of reference:

• Foster collaboration at both the national and international level, on Education and Outreach;
• Identify key international activities/events related to education and outreach for possible engagement by the Antarctic Treaty Parties;
• Share results of educational and outreach initiatives that demonstrate the work of Antarctic Treaty Parties in managing the Antarctic Treaty area;
• Emphasise ongoing environmental protection initiatives that have been informed by scientific observations and results, in order to reinforce the importance of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection;
• Promote related education and outreach activities by Experts and Observers, and encourage cooperation with these groups;
• Discuss the possibility for creation of an Antarctic Education and Outreach section at the ATS website; and
• Monitor and share information about educational and outreach activities related to the 25th Madrid Protocol anniversary celebrations undertaken in 2016.

Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and the United Kingdom, with the recent addition of Spain, will continue to form the Core Group which will moderate this forum.
