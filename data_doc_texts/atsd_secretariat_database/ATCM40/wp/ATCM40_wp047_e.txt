Report of the intersessional contact group established to develop guidance material for conservation approaches for the management of Antarctic heritage objects

Submitted by Norway and the United Kingdom

Summary

The 19th meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) agreed to establish an intersessional contact group (ICG) to examine developing guidance material for conservation approaches for the management of Antarctic heritage objects. This paper presents a report from the first year of the ICG, summarising the outcomes of discussions held during the 2016/17 intersessional period. It is recommended that the Committee: Request that the ICG on Heritage Management continues its work in the 2017-2018 intersessional period; and agrees to a modified Terms of Reference for the further work of the ICG ahead of producing guidance material for CEP XXI.

Introduction

The Committee for Environmental Protection (the Committee/CEP) had substantive and useful discussions on questions relating to management and conservation of heritage sites/objects in Antarctica at its meeting in Santiago in 2016 (CEP XIX). These discussions were founded on earlier discussions, as well as working papers submitted to the meeting. There was a high level of interest in this issue among Members, both from the perspective of enhancing the protection of historic sites and balancing the provisions of Annex III and Annex V.

On basis of those discussions, the Committee noted the desirability of continuing discussions and working toward providing members with the best possible guidance for assessing what conservation efforts may be relevant and appropriate for sites/objects being considered as potential HSM candidates. 

Consequently, the Committee decided to establish an intersessional contact group (ICG) to work during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 intersessional period(s) with the following Terms of Reference for the 2016/17 intersessional period1:

        1. Develop a work plan for the development of guidance for the consideration of the most appropriate conservation approaches to the management of historic heritage elements.
        2. Identify questions that could constitute the core elements of the guidance material to be developed for the assessment of potential conservation approaches that could be used for the management of historic heritage elements as an alternative to listing of the object as an HSM, including further exploration of inter alia the following questions: 
    • Consideration of how the age of an object in question has bearing on the management approach including its significance, current/recent usage and materials (including hazards);
    • Consideration of the national versus international significance of the heritage object in question; 
    • Consideration of whether the existing suite of Antarctic HSMs already adequately covers the value of the object in question; 
    • Consideration of whether an object is best maintained in situ to protect its value, or whether it can be better maintained and presented ex situ;
    • Consideration of whether an object would be better preserved or presented by archival methods or digitally;
    • Consideration of risks and challenges involved (resources and otherwise) in maintaining the object in situ and ex situ;
    • Consideration of the state of conservation of the object at the time of designation and the potential need for rapid actions, as appropriate (short term management);
    • Consideration of the medium-long term management plan for the object if kept in situ and the implications (expertise, costs, realization of benefits);
    • Consideration of the ‘objective’ of the heritage object, i.e. will it be visited by visitors to Antarctica; will it still be in use or part of a site still working; how does its management reflect its significance;
    • Consideration of the wider value of the object to the outside world – how will it be made accessible more widely (if no-one knows about it who will care about it?);
    • Identification of resources, relevant expertise and heritage organisations to offer guidance, advice;
    • Exploration of the value of implementing a model of best practice for the care of Antarctic heritage objects for all parties; and
    • Identification of, when appropriate, potential international partners to aid or collaborate with in the conservation planning and execution.
        3. Begin to implement the work plan as appropriate and work toward drafting of guidance material for the consideration of the CEP.
        4. Develop draft Terms of Reference for a second intersessional period. 
        5. Report on progress to CEP XX.

The Committee welcomed the offer from the CEP representatives of Norway (Birgit Njåstad) and UK (Stuart Doubleday) to act as ICG co-conveners. 

This working paper constitutes a summary of the work of the ICG in the first of its two intersessional periods, and provides a basis to inform and form the discussion for the second (and final) intersessional period.

Manner of work

Overall approach
The ICG agreed to the following framework for its work:

    • consider (and if possible agree to) some general and overarching principles relating to the management and conservation of historic heritage sites/objects in Antarctica; 
    • identify themes/issues relevant to include in guidance (ToR 2);
    • discuss and provide knowledge against the identified themes, leaning on expert advice (we would urge colleagues to consult directly with their national heritage experts not just with specifically polar conservationists), available literature and existing guidance material (ToR 2);
    • consider and agree to the aim and format of guidance material; 
    • consider and agree to the specific guidance to be provided against the various identified themes; and
    • develop the guidance material in substance.

The 2016-17 intersessional period
The ICG conducted two rounds of substantial discussions. The first round focused on overarching principles and inputs to and considerations of the list of themes provided in ToR 2, while the second round of discussion fine-tuned preliminary conclusions regarding some key overarching principles and started discussions on a framework for the guidance material to be developed. 

Discussions were constructive, interesting, complex and fruitful. Overall, 10 Members and Observers were involved in the discussions (Argentina, ASOC, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States). In addition, the co-conveners received input from the International Polar Heritage Committee (IPHC) in which was provided some views on an overarching level, which was posted on the CEP Discussion Forum for the attention of ICG members. A record of the full discussion, including all material developed during the process, is available on the online CEP Discussion Forum.

General discussions

Questions that could constitute the core elements of the guidance material 
The ICG agreed that the questions set out in ICG ToR 2 are largely comprehensive and relevant for inclusion and consideration in the guidance material. Members highlighted the importance of the criteria relating to management options. Contributors also emphasised the need to consider the long-term resources required to manage a site, the importance of the geographic location and the need to adequately consider environmental factors including the long-term cumulative impacts. There was concern expressed by some members however over the criteria relating to “whether the existing suite of HSMs adequately covered the object in question” and CEP Members will need to carefully reflect upon whether this matter is relevant and should be a consideration when assessing sites. Further discussions and reflections on the specifics will continue as the ICG develops the guidance material around the identified core questions.

Overarching vision / objective
During the discussions it was suggested that the guidance material to be developed could be usefully guided by an overarching vision or objective. The ICG has not yet conducted an in-depth discussion regarding such a vision or objective. The views of the CEPon this matter would be welcome. 

Overview of HSMs in Antarctica today
It was noted that having a common platform/overview/understanding of the current situation with regard to listed HSMs in Antarctica could usefully inform the further discussions. Noting that there may be a number of ways to define and categorize the existing HSMs, the following summary is useful as a backdrop to the discussions.

The 87 HSMs currently listed can be categorized into 5 main types, which again can be divided into a number of sub categories (Table 1). The information as visualized in Figure 1 illustrates that the current suite of HSMs consist of a relatively high proportion of commemorative elements that have been deliberately brought into or built in Antarctica to commemorate particular historical figure or event (44%). Old buildings (huts, base remains, etc.) represent 36 % of the HSMs. Overall there are few sites listed as HSM (7%).

Management options
In terms of how sites should be protected there was a clear and not unsurprising consensus in the ICG that each site is different and will require a different method and level of protection, appropriate to that site. Management plans are highlighted as important tools for protecting complex historic sites and it was during discussions noted that Annex V provides for such HSMs to be designated as ASPAs or ASMAs. A suggestion was made that a standardised template for ‘Antarctic management plans’ might be worthy of further discussion. The ICG noted that it would be helpful in the guidance material to provide an overview of the broad suite of management options available, with an emphasis on how to assess site/monuments against these various options. 

Heritage values and historic values
During the course of discussions, the ICG found it useful to consider the concepts of heritage values on the one hand and historic values on the other, to provide a platform for further discussions and considerations relating to heritage management in Antarctica. Discussions clearly indicated that i) there is a perceived difference between general heritage values and specific historic values, and that ii) there are nuances in how Parties understand and define these differences. 

The ICG notes that the understanding of these terms depends on national contexts, and the ICG does therefore not intend to reach a common definition of the terms within the CEP. The ICG does, however, note the important difference in that global discussions to a large degree focus on management of heritage values, while the Protocol specifically focus on historic values. Consequently, the ICG see merit in  i) establishing a common understanding that there indeed is a difference between the two terms and ii) have a general common understanding of the what this difference is without attempting to clearly define either of them. In short, the following reflections based on input by members is worth highlighting2:

    • Heritage values can be said to be more overarching than historic values, and often connotes a product, place, or such that evokes a nostalgic sense of tradition or history. Heritage values inform us about the past in general terms and the cultures of those who came before us, and provide tangible evidence of the continuity between past, present, and future. In an Antarctic context you could make a solid case that all evidence, vestige or object from human activity on the continent could be considered heritage.
    • A historic value connotes a product, place or such that dates from or is preserved from the past or relates to a specific event in the past. Other descriptions of a historic monument suggest that it is a unique human creation, an outcome of human will, whose establishment had a significant impact on humanity or a part of it or are objects or sites that are important to a specific time or a moment in history. 
    • Very broadly it may be noted and understood that a historic value is to be seen as a specific subset of the wider concept of heritage values, and relates more concretely to a specific event that took place in the (up to recent) past. What constitutes historic in terms of time can be interpreted a number of ways and does have bearings on question relating to the management of historic values. 
    • It is also worth noting that ICOMOS (International Council of Monuments and Sites), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and WMF (World Monument Foundation) no longer focus merely on the heritage objects themselves, but rather consider heritage from a more holistic standpoint, an approach often referred to as “enhancement”. The aim of enhancement is not merely to ensure the conservation of the objects in questions, but includes the concept of dissemination so that the heritage value created by the object can be used by present and future generations. 
    • Most nations have their own national definition of what constitutes a historic value per se, to a large degree shaped by the national needs and interests and “life stage of the nation”. 
In the Antarctic context Article 8 of Annex V gives the only Treaty criteria for a listing an HSM as “recognised historic value”. However, Parties have broadly agreed that to have a “recognised historic value” the object or site should meet at least one of the following (non-specified) criteria3:

    a. a particular event of importance in the history of science or exploration of Antarctica occurred at the place; 
    b. a particular association with a person who played an important role in the history of science or exploration in Antarctica; 
    c. a particular association with a notable feat of endurance or achievement;
    d. representative of, or forms part of, some wide-ranging activity that has been important in the development and knowledge of Antarctica; 
    e. particular technical, historical, cultural or architectural value in its materials, design or method of construction; 
    f. the potential, through study, to reveal information or has the potential to educate people about significant human activities in Antarctica; 
    g. symbolic or commemorative value for people of many nations.


The terms “sites” and “monuments”
During the course of discussions, the ICG found it useful to consider the terms “site” and “monument”, as these are fundamental terms in the HSM framework.  These terms do not have clear definitions, and largely depend on national contexts and national legal frameworks. The ICG does not intend to agree to a shared definition of these terms, but has found it useful to reflect on their differences and strengthen the basis for a common understanding of the terms.  In short, the following reflections based on input by members is worth highlighting in this regard4:
    • A site can in simple terms be said to be the position or location of a building, object, etc. A site is as such space, rather than object. 
    • A monument can be described as an enduring evidence or notable example of something, be it time, event, process, etc. As such, a monument is a concrete object, i.e. building, megalith, etc., surviving from a past age, and regarded as of importance in a heritage or historic context. 
    • Memorials or commemorative objects have often been introduced (in a relatively modern timescale) to maintain focus on a historic or heritage site, event or object. In the Antarctic context, this category could be said to include all cultural goods or property, both movable and immovable (such as plaques, busts, landmarks, etc.) which have been installed to commemorate individuals, events or processes linked to the history of man in Antarctica subsequent to the event being commemorated (i.e. more recently). 
Members noted in general that commemorative elements in themselves do not necessarily have the same significance and value as the original historical elements, but also note that there are existing examples that illustrate that this question may not be as straightforward and simple as indicated here. It was also noted that it may be appropriate to not place commemorative markers at historic sites and monuments, in meeting the requirements of the Protocol in minimizing impacts to the Antarctic environment. In this regard, the ICG has engaged in a discussion as to whether a commemorative object/sign in itself necessarily need to be inscribed on the HSM list, but has not yet concluded on this discussion. 

Universal values 
During the course of discussions, the ICG found it useful to consider whom an object or site has value for when considering the heritage value of an object or site, as this will influence management options and choices. It was noted that the significance of a heritage object or site may differ substantially depending on whether it is assessed in a local, regional, national or international context. 

Although there are no provisions in the Protocol or other guidance material from the Treaty system that dictates that the heritage value at hand must have universal importance to merit protection, the ICG nevertheless found it useful to consider the concept of universality and the bearings this has for protection and management options. In short, the following reflections based on input by members is worth highlighting in this regard5:   

    • In the context of UNESCO’s World Heritage List it has been expressed that for something to be listed it must have outstanding universal value, meaning that it has cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity. As such, the permanent protection of this heritage is of the highest importance to the international community as a whole. 
    • What this could indicate is that for elements that are remarkable from solely a national or regional perspective it is relevant to consider and develop other protection and management approaches to recognize the value of these objects and places.
    • That further clarity would be needed on how to determine whether universal values could be clearly defined and assessed. 
    • The ability to protect sites/objects of national or regional significance should not be lost and that this should be carefully considered in any attempt to move toward the concept of universality.

In continuing its discussions the ICG will consider whether there could be merit in moving toward an understanding that designation of historic sites and monuments in Antarctica (in accordance with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol) potentially should intend to secure a representation of Antarctic historic heritage that have universal or “broad”6 importance for the global and/or full Antarctic community. 

Should the CEP wish to take this approach it will be essential to develop a clear assessment criterion that considers, amongst others, concepts of exceptionality, uniqueness and representativeness. Careful consideration would also need to be given to the consequence of such an approach for objects and sites that have a more regional/national significance, including the possibility that other management approaches may be more relevant. . It has also be suggested that the ICG gives further consideration to consider a grading system to determine the intrinsic, comparative and contextual significance of a heritage resource, noting that UNESCO’s criteria could be useful in guiding such considerations. Recognizing the challenge of the task, the ICG notes that the practical challenges in determining the universal or “broad” importance of a proposed site needs further consideration.

Being fully aware that each nation potentially have unique objects or sites that are important to the Antarctic history/heritage of that particular country, it was noted that developing and introducing a mechanism that recognizes nationally or regionally important historic sites could be a solution.

Guidance material

The charge of the ICG over the two intersessional periods is to produce guidance on how best to preserve heritage and historic values present in Antarctica. During the second round of discussions, the ICG discussed and commented on a first draft framework for Guidelines for the assessment of Heritage and Historic Sites in Antarctica (available on the CEP Discussion Forum). Generally speaking, the ICG was content with the structure provided in the current draft framework, reflecting both the CEP XIX discussion and the discussions so far in the ICG. The intent contained in the draft framework is to assist both those making an initial assessment of a heritage site/object, both in the context of Annex III and Annex V, and the CEP in evaluating submissions/proposals for new HSMs. The twin objectives of the guidance to be provided is 1) to decide whether a heritage site/object merits HSM designation and 2) what management option best suits the object in question. ICG members have provided comments to the draft framework, which will be further developed and discussed in the next intersessional period, ultimately leading to the development of a populated Guideline document. 

Next steps / intersessional period

The ICG will continue its work in the 2017-2018 intersessional period, in accordance with the stipulated work plan (cf. section 3.1). The ICG suggests that the second intersessional period should be framed within the following draft modified Terms of Reference:

    1. To finalize draft guidelines for the consideration of the CEP relating to the assessment of Heritage and Historic Sites in Antarctica, based on the discussion conducted in the 2016-17 intersessional period and informed by the discussions at CEP XX. These guidelines should cover:
    • Providing guidance for considering whether a site/object merits HSM designation; and
    • Providing guidance to management options for HSMs.

    2. To liaise in this work with international and national heritage experts as appropriate.

    3. Guidance material will be produced for consideration at CEP XXI.

Noting that the CEP has already agreed a two-year timeframe for the completion of this work, the ICG co-conveners remain committed to that timeline. However given the complexity of the work and need to engage with a range of appropriate experts we would highlight to the CEP that it may become necessary to seek an additional year of ICG discussions should it become apparent that the task cannot be completed to a high enough standard ahead of CEP XXI.

Recommendations

Norway and the United Kingdom propose that the CEP:

    • Request that the ICG on Heritage Management continues its work in the 2017-2018 intersessional period in accordance with agreed work plan; and 
    • Agrees to the following modified Terms of Reference for the further work of the ICG:

    1. To finalize draft guidelines for the consideration of the CEP relating to the assessment of Heritage and Historic Sites in Antarctica, based on the discussion conducted in the 2016-17 intersessional period and informed by the discussions at CEP XX. These guidelines should cover:
            ▪ Providing guidance for considering whether a site/object merits HSM designation; and
            ▪ Providing guidance to management options for HSMs.

    2. To liaise in this work with international and national heritage experts as appropriate.

    3. Guidance material will be produced for consideration at CEP XXI.
