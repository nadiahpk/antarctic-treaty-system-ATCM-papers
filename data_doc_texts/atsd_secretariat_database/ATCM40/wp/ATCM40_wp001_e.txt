Future Antarctic Science Challenges – A UK Perspective
Future Antarctic Science Challenges – A UK Perspective
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom proposed for ATCM XL a new sub-agenda
item, under item 15 of the Preliminary Agenda: Science Issues,
Scientific Cooperation and Facilitation, on Future Antarctic Science
Challenges. In doing this, the UK’s objective was to encourage a
discussion among the Parties on the big future science questions
facing Antarctica, particularly on issues that may have policy
implications for the ATCM. The UK also proposes that the ATCM
considers how it identifies when scientific advice would be
desirable, and how it should best prioritise and commission
scientific advice. This paper sets out the UK’s thoughts on this issue.
UK Antarctic Programme Science Priorities
The United Kingdom published its priorities for science in
Antarctica during the period 2014-2020, and the specific priorities
for the British Antarctic Survey over the next few years were
summarised in ATCMXXXIX/IP40. The UK’s primary challenges for
Antarctic research to 2020 are:
Understanding and managing environmental change through
sustained observation and studies of physical processes, modelling
of Antarctic systems and projecting their role within the future
Earth system;
Understanding Antarctic biodiversity and how it supports vital
natural services, conservation of marine living resources and
commercial fishing activity; and
Advancing knowledge through curiosity-driven research where the
benefits to society emerge as the research progresses.
The Antarctic science challenges identified by the UK focused on
climate change implications – both within Antarctica, and the
consequences of Antarctic change on the rest of the world. The key
challenges were identified as:
Understanding global environmental change, and refining
knowledge about past, present and future change, including:
Sea-level rise – particularly around understanding the ocean-
atmosphere and rock bed interactions controlling ice-sheet flow and
evolution;
Global ocean circulation – focusing on the identification of
processes that initiate and drive the overturning circulation in the
Southern Ocean;
The climate of the Antarctic – to explain changes in atmospheric
circulation, temperature and sea-ice extent over the past 50 years,
and seek to determine how much of this change is due to human
activity;
Understanding biodiversity for responsible management of the
environment, including to:
Understand what determines the ability of species to adapt to
change through genetic, physiological and ecological processes;
Develop quantitative descriptions of the life-cycles of species to
determine their likely response to environmental change;
Determine the resilience of polar ecosystems to past and current
climate change; and
Provide data and policy advice on key species and whole
ecosystems to underpin further development of sustainable fisheries
management in the Southern Ocean.
Exploring the frontiers of knowledge, with a particular focus on:
Mapping the geological structure of the unexplored Antarctic
continental interior;
Searching for life in recently discovered lakes and connected
hydrological systems under the Arctic ice sheet;
Making oceanographic measurements in previously inaccessible
ocean cavities beneath Antarctic ice shelves;
Understanding the environmental niches that support highly-
adapted Antarctic species;
Investigating the atmosphere above Antarctica where unique
chemical processes occur, including the formation of the Antarctic
Ozone Hole;
Using the unique observing locations of Antarctica to study space
weather.
The UK’s Antarctic science priorities, as outlined above, also took
into account the outcomes of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR) Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon
Scan, which had identified 80 priority science questions in 2014. By
presenting the priority issues and challenges for the UK Antarctic
science programme, the UK invites other Parties who have
identified similar scientific priorities, and with whom the UK is not
already collaborating, to engage with the UK National Antarctic
Programme to identify any opportunities for new cooperation.
International Scientific Collaboration in Antarctica
Many of the scientific priority questions and challenges for
Antarctica require significant and sustained investment. The
Antarctic Treaty provides an effective framework for international
scientific collaboration across the continent; since multi-national
scientific collaborations are vital for addressing the biggest
questions about changes and the consequences of these changes in
Antarctica. The UK actively pursues national and international
collaborations and is utilising the major advances in, for example,
polar satellite and airborne technologies, mathematical modelling,
risk analysis and genetics to provide a launch pad for innovation.
The UK Antarctic programme is also seeking new opportunities to
utilise Antarctic expertise to work with business and industry to
develop novel products and services that deliver economic, societal
and environmental benefits.
SCAR provides a very effective forum for initiating, developing and
co-ordinating international scientific research in, and relating to,
Antarctica. Where appropriate, or requested, SCAR presents advice
on scientific matters to the Committee for Environmental Protection
and the Antarctic Treaty System. Its scientific priorities are driven
through the SCAR Delegates’ Meetings, which take place every two
years. There is very good overlap between those attending the SCAR
meetings and delegates at the ATCM, however, whilst the ATCM
regularly articulates specific questions to SCAR during its meetings,
it has not, at least for some time, had
a focused discussion about forthcoming priority issues on which
scientific advice would be helpful.
Recommendations
In proposing a bespoke agenda item to propose a focused discussion
on the future Antarctic science challenges, the UK was keen to
achieve two main objectives:
Firstly, to encourage all Parties to submit information about their
Antarctic science priorities over the next few years, to enable
Parties to identify synergies and new opportunities for collaborative
working and logistical cooperation; and
Secondly, to encourage the ATCM to reflect on when and how it
receives, and commissions, scientific advice, and to consider
whether it would be helpful to identify some key priorities over the
coming few years, where specific scientific advice would be helpful
– perhaps drawing on the Multi-Year Strategic Workplan.
