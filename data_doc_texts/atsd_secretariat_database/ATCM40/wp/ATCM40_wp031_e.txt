A Strategic Approach to Environmentally Managed Tourism








A Strategic Approach to Environmentally Managed Tourism
Working paper submitted by New Zealand
Summary
At its XXXIX meeting the ATCM agreed to commence work to develop a common vision of Antarctic tourism, following discussion of WP 28 Report of the Intersessional Contact Group ‘Developing a Strategic Approach to Environmentally Managed Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities’.  This paper lays out a general framework that builds on the ATCM’s previous work on tourism, including the framework provided by Resolution 7 (2009) General Principles of Antarctic Tourism, to present a strategic approach focussed on active and effective management of tourism activities by Antarctic Treaty Parties. 
Background: Common Values, Common Concerns
Tourist visitor numbers continue to grow in Antarctica and the diversity of activities and tourism operators continue to expand. ATCPs have agreed that all tourist activities shall be conducted in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty, its Protocol on Environmental Protection, and relevant ATCM Measures and Resolutions. Core elements such as a precautionary approach, risk-based assessment and priority for scientific research were agreed in the 2009 General Principles on Antarctic Tourism1.  These supplement a large body of previously agreed Recommendations, Measures and Resolutions addressing specific concerns relating to tourism. There is, for example, a resolution stating that tourism activities should have no more than a minor or transitory impact intended to constrain the development of permanent land-based tourism infrastructure,2 and a requirement that tourist activities be self-sufficient.3 
Further work is required by ATCPs to bring into force a number of relevant Measures relating to tourism. These include Measure 4 (2004) on insurance and contingency planning, and Measure 15 (2009), imposing restrictions on tourist landing numbers.  It is also clear that industry self-regulation, while having had some successes, has certain limitations with respect to governance and enforcement (particularly in the context of an increase in operators outside of industry bodies). The implications of potential new developments, such as non-governmental facilities developed in the absence of an appropriate Environmental Impact Assessment, risk undermining the authority of the Antarctic Treaty System to govern Antarctica. 
It has been highlighted, including through the CEP Tourism Study, that many ATCPs are uneasy about whether there is an accurate understanding of the environmental impact of tourism activities and that more needs to be done to monitor the effects of tourism. 
The General Principles identified in Resolution 7 (2009) remain relevant and represent the agreed common values of the ATCM as they relate to tourism. However, a strategic approach to environmentally managed tourism requires further operationalization of these Principles. 
 A strategic approach must therefore do the following:
    • Ensure  tourism has no or minimal impact on the values of Article 3(1) of the Protocol;
    • Ensure tourism is effectively managed;
    • Ensure the primacy of science in Antarctica; and
    • Promote consistency in approach to permitting of tourism activities by Antarctic Treaty Parties.

Components of a Strategic Approach
Monitoring and Data Management
To be effective and to give full realisation to the Environmental Protocol, a strategic approach to environmentally managed tourism must be supported and guided by comprehensive monitoring and useable data that is well-managed, standardised and able to be easily shared between Parties. We envisage data collected would focus on:
    • Identifying impacts on Antarctic values, including cumulative impacts at frequently used sites;
    • Monitoring trends in tourist activities; and
    • Tracking numbers of tourists overall and site-specifically.
Currently, some such data is collected by National Antarctic Programmes, the tourism industry, and non-governmental organisations, including in partnership with a number of Governments. But there is no standardised approach to monitoring and there are limitations to the data available to Governments.  A strategic approach should include consistent monitoring at key sites to gauge the impact of tourism on the environment, as well as continuing to develop a centrally-managed database within the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat. Analysis of the data collected would allow the ATCM and/or CEP to:
    • assess whether a current tourist site is being appropriately managed; 
    • enable problems to be identified and addressed as early as possible; 
    • evaluate the suitability of opening up new sites for tourism; 
    • determine whether restrictions need to be placed on tourist numbers, geography of sites, or activities able to be undertaken, generally or regionally;
    • assess the desirability of inspections of tourism activities and facilities; and
    • assist in determining whether new tourism regulations needed to be developed more broadly.
Review, Implementation and Development of Tourism Measures
There are a number of existing measures relating to tourism and non-governmental activities still to enter into force. Parties must ensure they implement any measures they have not yet done so as to bring these into force system-wide.
At the same time, any strategic approach must be agile and responsive. Existing measures, in force or not, should be regularly reviewed by the ATCM, and updated to ensure they remain relevant to the contemporary tourism operating environment. A review schedule for such updates should be included in the multi-year strategic work plan.
New measures should be developed in response to analysis of the data collected through the environmental monitoring programme outlined above, or on the basis of information generated by operators through post-visit reports. New measures should be developed alongside, and in reference to, existing measures to ensure system coherence. Maximum efficiency in the development and implementation of new tourism measures can be ensured through instituting a standardised process using of a forward work plan that provides for adequate discussion. 
Industry Involvement
While Antarctic tourism should rightly be regulated by the Antarctic Treaty Parties, the scale of activity makes it unrealistic and impractical to ignore the role industry has to play in tourism management. ATCPs are already encouraged to cooperate with industry to coordinate activities and share best practice on safety and environmental management issues, and IAATO provides valuable input to discussions at ATCM as an invited expert. The further development of this type of constructive partnership between the tourism industry and governments will be crucial to the successful implementation of the strategic vision. Moreover, the collective expertise of tourism operators may be beneficial in providing an operational lens on the development of new measures and resolutions. As some of the most regular visitors to key sites, we foresee a role for industry in assisting in the implementation of the monitoring programme outlined above.
We suggest establishing a mechanism that would allow regular and transparent contact with industry outside of the ATCM, where ATCPs could engage with industry on policy developments and where both could raise any issues of particular concern.   
Conclusion and next steps
The ATCM has been grappling with how to manage Antarctic tourism for decades now. Parties have generally approached the topic in a piecemeal manner, dealing with specific issues as they arise instead of within the structure of an agreed upon strategy. With tourism increasing, activities diversifying, and increasing numbers of operators outside of industry bodies, it is critical the ATCM institute a strategic approach to environmentally managed tourism that operationalises the 2009 General Principles already agreed to by ATCPs.We see such an approach as consisting of:
    • comprehensive environmental monitoring and data collection to guide policy-makers in developing tourism regulations and designating tourism sites;
    • a regular review mechanism to allow the ATCM to keep up with industry trends;
    • use of the multi-year strategic work plan to actively identify, develop and implement tourism regulations; and
    • the active inclusion of industry in discussions on tourism policy. 

We anticipate that further discussion on how to operationalise this approach will be necessary, which should be done through the use of the ATCM multi-year strategic work plan supplemented by intersessional work between Parties. 
Recommendations 
It is recommended the ATCM
    1. Adopt the following strategic approach:
        a. That Antarctic tourism serves to enhance global understanding of the need to protect Antarctica and should have no more than a minor or transitory impact;
        b. That the environmental impact of tourist and non-governmental activities in Antarctica are understood through a system of environmental monitoring and data collection, and that negative environmental impacts are prevented through proactive responses to that data;
        c. That ATCPs take a consistent approach to site management that includes the development of criteria assessing the suitability of a site for tourism and sets thresholds for its use;
        d. That all tourist and non-governmental activities in Antarctica remain under the governance of the Antarctic Treaty System and its ATCPs, which will regularly review the effectiveness of the regime;
        e. That ATCPs have a common understanding of how to regulate Antarctic tourism and actively do so, including through strong and effective instruments that seek to address issues arising from tourism and non-governmental activities in a proactive way; 
        f. That ATCPs will efficiently and effectively implement and enforce new and existing instruments relating to tourism and non-governmental activities, and apply a consistent and precautionary approach to the authorisation of these activities; and
        g. That ATCPs will work constructively with the tourism industry on the identification and resolution of issues arising from tourism and non-governmental activities.
    2. Populate the multi-year strategic work plan to begin operationalising the strategic approach from ATCM 41 onwards.
