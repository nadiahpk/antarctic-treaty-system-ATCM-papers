Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2016-17

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina and Chile in conjunction with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Summary

Since 2010, the United Kingdom and IAATO have provided reports to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic during each previous season (ATCMXXXIII/WP52; ATCMXXXIV/WP20; ATCMXXXV/IP42; ATCM XXXVI/IP54; ATCM XXXVII/IP55; ATCM XXXVIII/IP96). Additionally, Argentina has in past years provided reports informing of yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia (ATCMXXXIV/IP21rev.1; ATCMXXXVII/IP88; ATCMXXXVIII/IP127rev.1). Last year the UK and IAATO joined with Chile and Argentina to present ATCM XXXIX/WP34.

This paper consolidates information from the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile and IAATO relating to yachts sighted in Antarctica, or indicating an intention to travel to Antarctica, during the 2016-17 season.  The paper also recommends that Parties invite all those vessels that they authorise to visit Antarctica to report, as soon as possible, any yachts sighted in Antarctica which are not listed in the EIES Summarised Report of authorised vessels. 

Background

The ATCM has previously welcomed information about sighted yacht activities, which has enabled Parties to consider the overall volume of yachts known to be visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate authorisations for such activities had been obtained. 

As in previous years, this paper includes information collected as part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and vessels) at the UK-operated base Port Lockroy; information from Argentina on yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia, as well as yachts visiting Argentine operated Brown station; information provided by Chile based on details recorded from yachts indicating an intention to travel from Puerto Williams/Punta Arenas to Antarctica; and incidental sightings recorded by IAATO members. It would be helpful if Parties could provide any supplementary material which adds to or verifies this information. 

A total of 33 yachts were sighted in, or reported an intention to sail to, Antarctica during the 2016-17 season.  This represented a slight decrease from 41 reported in 2015-16.  Just less than half were IAATO members (table 1); 13 were non-IAATO members but had Party authorisation to travel to Antarctica (table 2); and 5 unauthorised vessels were sighted (table 3).

Parties are reminded that the EIES contains a summarised reporting tool, which can generate a complete list of all vessels included in pre-season information as having obtained authorisation to operate in Antarctica (http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ie_reports.aspx?lang=e).  This facility makes it much easier to determine whether a yacht is authorised, and consequently, this may be a useful tool for use in-season to expedite the verification of the authorisation status of any sighted yachts.

Recommendation

Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile and IAATO believe that it is important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting activities in Antarctica and encourages Parties to share information about yachts they have authorised through the EIES Pre-Season Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5 (2005). We would also point to the continuing activity of yachts that have been in the region without authorisation from a Treaty Party and urge the ATCM to consider further the matter of unauthorised yachts.
