Updated Management Plan and maps for Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 5 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, South Pole









Updated Management Plan and maps for ASMA No. 5 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, South Pole 
Working Paper submitted by the United States and Norway
Summary
The area surrounding Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station was originally designated as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 5 through Measure 2 (2007) in order to preserve its scientific, environmental and historical values and in view of the need to coordinate management of activities to ensure that these values can be sustained for the long-term.  Since the adoption of the Management Plan in 2007 five Management Reports were submitted (ATCM XXXI – Information Paper (IP) 109 (2008), ATCM XXXIII – IP092 (2010), ATCM XXXIV – IP073 (2011), ATCM XXXV – IP078 (2012), ATCM XXXIX – IP033 (2016)) which mainly deal with the management of non-governmental activities and providing up to date maps.  A number of updates to the Management Plan and maps for ASMA No. 5 have been necessary to ensure that visitors to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station follow the latest policies agreed and have access to current information.  The following sections briefly describe the proposed amendments to the management plan and maps.
Background
Formal review of the ASMA No. 5 Management Plan was initiated in 2012 in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol, and this work has been on-going.  Owing to the complexity of South Pole operations, this review process required a substantial amount of time.  For example, there have been major changes to infrastructure at the South Pole such as demolition and removal of the former Station dome structure, completion of the substantial new elevated station facility, repositioning of the ski-way, and revisions to Non-Governmental Visitor procedures during the centennials of Amundsen’s and Scott’s historic expeditions.  The United States has submitted Information Papers as noted above and held a number of meetings of the South Pole Management Group at CEP meetings to report regularly to Parties and interested groups on progress, noting management issues and changes occurring in the Area since 2007.
Most recently, Information Paper IP033 (ATCM XXXIX, Santiago, 2016) was submitted by the United States and Norway to report on work undertaken by the ASMA Management Group.  This IP reported, inter alia, on an initiated review of values to be protected and management zones and sectors.
These reviews, which have involved consultation with more than 50 members of the science community, with the station management team, and with input from Non-Governmental Visitor groups including IAATO, have now been completed.  Based on the inputs received during the consultations, adjustments have been made to the Management Plan as needed to ensure that all activities can be conducted safely, environmentally responsibly and without disruption to scientific programs, while at the same time protecting the near-pristine environment.
Norway, as a member of the South Pole Management Group, has actively taken part in the revision of the Management Plan.  Other Parties and Observers have provided valuable contributions during the review process.  The Management Group welcomes interested Members to attend the Management Group Meetings which are held in the margins of meetings of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).

Summary of amendments to the management plan for ASMA No. 5
Several revisions and updates to the management plan and maps have been made further to the Non-Governmental Visitor approach guidelines set out in IP033 (2016).  The original Management Plan defined zones and sectors as a primary means to manage potentially conflicting activities at the South Pole.  This management framework has, in general, worked well since the original plan was adopted in 2007.  As a result, the revised Management Plan remains largely consistent with that approach, and revisions made are considered refinements and incremental improvements based on experience using the management plan since it was adopted.
In particular, the boundary of the ASMA remains unchanged.  The Scientific Zone, which extends to the outer boundary of the ASMA, and its division into Clean Air, Quiet, Downwind and Dark sectors remain key elements of the plan.  However, several changes have been made to other zones within the ASMA to maintain consistency with the latest discussions on zoning within the CEP and to simplify the plan.  In addition, some minor adjustments have been made to the size of the Operations Zone and Quiet Sector to take account of practical operational experience and needs since 2007.  The principal changes made to the Zones and Sectors may be summarized as follows:
    • The ski-way was moved Grid SW by ~1500 m in 2008/09 to place aircraft operations wholly outside of the Clean Air Sector (IP092, ATCM XXXIII, 2010).  The Operations Zone boundary is extended in the revised Management Plan to include the full extent of the ski-way to take account of this change.
    • The Operations Zone boundary was shifted Grid SE by 800 m where it adjoins the Quiet and Downwind Sectors, which were reduced accordingly.
    • The Quiet Circle was removed to simplify the plan. There was ambiguity in the original plan about policy application between the Quiet Circle and the Quiet Sector.  The revision of the Quiet Sector boundary removed the need for the Quiet Circle, and policies now applying within the Quiet Sector are clear and unambiguous.
    • Restricted Zones were established to maintain consistency with the CEP discussions on zoning.   Specifically, the former “Hazardous Zones”, “De-motorized Zone”, “Operational Communications Area”, and the “Antenna Field” were re-named as “Restricted Zones”.
    • New survey data showed that the communications facilities formerly understood to lie within the “Operational Communications Area” were actually located ~150 m to Grid W.  The boundary of the Restricted Zone for these facilities was therefore revised to reflect their true positons.  In addition, a boundary has now been defined for the Antenna Field Restricted Zone.
    • The Historic Zone listed in the original plan has been removed. This zone included several historic features, although no boundary was defined.  The approach taken in the revised management plan has been to list designated Historic Sites and Monuments in Section 6(iv) Location of other protected areas within the Area, noting their locations as defined in the official listing maintained by the Antarctic Treaty Parties.  Sites of informal historic interest such as the Ceremonial South Pole are listed in Section 6(i) Description of the Area.
A new Appendix A General Environmental Guidelines has been added to the plan. The purpose of the appendix is to elaborate the Code of Conduct with more specific and practical guidance on environmental policies.  This is consistent with the approach taken in ASMA No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys and ASMA No. 7 Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin, where this approach has worked well.
The management plan has been restructured to accommodate the revised zoning framework noted above, adding Appendix C Guidelines for Restricted Zones.  An appendix for the Operations Zone was not considered necessary, with applicable policies covered elsewhere in the plan.
The former single Appendix A in the original plan providing guidance for Non-Governmental Visitors has been split into Appendices D and E.  The purpose of the split is to provide clear, practical instructions to Non-Governmental Visitors, with policies on access provided in one succinct appendix that is easy for visitors to follow.  The general order of the revised Appendices follows the example provided by ASMA No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys, the most recent version of which was adopted by Measure 18 (2015).
More specific revisions to the Management Plan text are summarised in Appendix 1, while revisions to the Management Plan maps are summarised in Appendix 2, where the relevant sections changed have been identified.  The full text of the revised Management Plan, Appendices A – E that form part of the Management Plan, and the revised maps (now six in number, compared with four maps in the original plan) are attached.
Recommendations
