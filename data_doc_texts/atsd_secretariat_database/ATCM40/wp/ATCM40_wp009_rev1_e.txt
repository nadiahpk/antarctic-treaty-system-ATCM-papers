Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 129 Rothera Point, Adelaide Island

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 129 Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No. 129 Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, in accordance with Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
Rothera Point was originally designated through Recommendation XIII-8 (1985, SSSI No. 9) after a proposal by the United Kingdom. The primary reason for the designation of Rothera Point, Adelaide Island (Lat. 68o07’S, Long. 67o34’W), as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area is to protect scientific values, primarily that the Area would serve as a control area, against which the effects of human impact associated with the adjacent Rothera Research Station (UK) could be monitored in an Antarctic fellfield ecosystem.  The Area itself has little intrinsic nature conservation value.
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 129 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Management Plan. Minor amendments are summarised as follows:
    • A reference to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to the Introduction.
    • Annex 1 Supporting Information has been updated, based upon new scientific information.
    • The following text has been added under section 7(ii) Access to and movement within or over the Area: ‘Overflight of bird colonies within the Area by Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) at an altitude likely to result in harmful interference shall not be permitted unless in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate national authority.’
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA Management Plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.

The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 129 Rothera Point, Adelaide Island (Attachment A).
